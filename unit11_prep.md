**Importance:** Builds foundation for reading.

### Fluency
Ability to read with speed, accuracy, expression.

**Problems:**
- Decoding issues
- Slow reading
- Lack of expression
- Subvocalization
- Low WCPM (words correct per minute)

**Improving Fluency:**
- Track words while reading aloud
- Choral reading
- Cloze reading
- Partner reading

### Reasoning and Background Knowledge
Background knowledge enables understanding multiple meanings, inferences.

**Deductive Reasoning:** Draw conclusions from facts.

## Key Terms
- **Decoding:** Sounding out words
- **Fluency:** Smooth reading
- **Vocabulary:** Word knowledge
- **Inference:** Reading between lines
- **Background Knowledge:** Prior information
