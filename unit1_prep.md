## Key Concepts

### What is a Sentence?
A sentence is a meaningful collection of words that expresses a statement, question, or order.

**Examples:**
- I met him at a bookstore.
- She is late for the meeting.
- What a pleasant weather!
- Do you like tea?
- My friend is not diligent.

### Difference from Clause and Phrase
- **Clause:** A group of words with a subject and verb. Can be independent (stands alone) or dependent (cannot stand alone).
  - Examples: "She is honest" (independent), "When he came here" (dependent).
- **Phrase:** A group of words without a subject-verb combination. Cannot stand alone as a sentence.
  - Examples: "His tail between his legs", "On the table", "Fool’s paradise", "Flick of a wrist".

### Basic Structure of a Sentence
- Subject + Verb (+ Object/Complement)

### Types of Sentences
Based on structure, there are 4 main types:

1. **Simple Sentence:** One independent clause.
   - Examples: "The train was late" (Subject: The train; Verb: was late). "I am sorry" (Subject: I; Verb: am sorry).

2. **Compound Sentence:** At least two independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or semicolon.
   - Examples: I want to see him soon, for he has been in Australia. The students finished the class and went for lunch.

3. **Complex Sentence:** One independent clause and one or more dependent clauses joined by subordinating conjunctions (although, when, if, unless, etc.).
   - Examples: Although my friend is intelligent, he could not pass. When my friends visit me, we have a gala time.

4. **Compound-Complex Sentence:** Elements of both compound and complex sentences.
   - Examples: Though James prefers watching football, he started enjoying cricket because he understood the rules.

### Transformation of Sentences
Converting sentences from one type to another.

**Examples:**
- Simple to Compound: Besides being intelligent, she is diligent. → She is not only intelligent but also diligent.
- Simple to Complex: His opinion did not matter. → What he opined did not matter.
- Compound to Complex: Get two dresses and get one free. → If you get two dresses, you get one free.

## Key Terms
- **Conjunction:** Words that link words, phrases, or clauses.
  - Coordinating: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
  - Correlative: either/or, neither/nor, not only/but also
  - Subordinating: after, although, as, before, if, since, unless, when, while, etc.
