# Unit 8 Exam Preparation: Speaking Skills - Pronunciation

## Objectives
After studying this unit, you will be able to:
- Understand the meaning and aspects of pronunciation, vowel and consonant sounds in English language
- Become well versed with the peculiarities of English pronunciation, classification of vowel and consonant sounds
- Get an overview of the rules and exceptions in English pronunciation, articulators involved in the production of vowel and consonant sounds

## Key Concepts

### Aspects of Pronunciation
- Vowels
- Consonants
- Voicing
- Aspiration
- Assimilation
- Elision
- Word Stress
- Sentence Stress
- Intonation

### Vowels
Speech sounds produced without obstruction in airflow.

**Classification:**
- Front/Back/Central
- Close/Open/Mid
- Rounded/Unrounded

**Monophthongs:** Single vowel sound (12 in English: /ɪ/, /e/, /æ/, /ʌ/, /ʊ/, /ɒ/, /ə/, /iː/, /ɑː/, /ɔː/, /ɜː/, /uː/)

**Diphthongs:** Two vowel sounds (8: /eɪ/, /oʊ/, /aʊ/, /ɪə/, /eə/, /ɔɪ/, /aɪ/, /ʊə/)

**Cardinal Vowels:** Reference points for vowel description.

### Consonants
Speech sounds with obstruction in airflow.

**Place of Articulation:**
- Bilabial, Labiodental, Dental, Alveolar, Postalveolar, Retroflex, Palatal, Velar, Uvular, Glottal

**Manner of Articulation:**
- Plosive, Fricative, Affricate, Nasal, Lateral, Approximant, Trill, Tap

**Voicing:** Voiced vs. Voiceless.

### Voicing in Pronunciation
Voiced sounds vibrate vocal cords (vowels, b,d,g,m,n, etc.); voiceless do not (p,t,k,f,s, etc.).

### Aspiration
Puff of air after voiceless stops at word start (pin vs. bin).

### Assimilation
One sound changes to match another (broadcast → /ˈbrɔːdkæst/).

### Elision
Sound deletion (tasteless → /ˈteɪstləs/).

### Word Stress
Emphasis on syllables (intensity, pitch, duration).

### Intonation
Melodic pattern; rising/falling tones for meaning.

## Key Terms
- **Phoneme:** Smallest sound unit
- **Articulator:** Speech organ (lips, tongue, etc.)
- **Syllable:** Unit of speech with vowel
- **Stress:** Emphasis on syllable
- **Tone:** Pitch variation
