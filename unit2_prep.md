## Key Concepts

### What are Articles?
Articles fall under the category of determiners in English grammar. They are used in the beginning of a noun phrase in a sentence.

They are divided into two types:
- Definite Articles: 'The'
- Indefinite Articles: 'A' and 'An'

### Differences between Indefinite and Definite Articles
- Indefinite Articles: Used with singular countable nouns, for non-specific person/thing, in general talk.
- Definite Articles: Used with all nouns (countable/uncountable, singular/plural), for specific people/things, in particular talk.

### Rules for using 'a' and 'an'
- Rule 1: Use a/an before singular common nouns.
- Rule 2: Use 'a' before words beginning with consonant sounds.
- Rule 3: Use 'an' before words beginning with vowel sounds.

**Examples:**
- A bag, an airplane, a university, an honest person.

### Rules for using 'the'
- Rule 1: Use 'the' when meaning something in particular.
- Rule 2: Use 'the' with names of rivers, seas, oceans, bays, banks, hotels, musical instruments, mountain ranges, municipal/government departments, substances in particular sense.
- Rule 3: Use 'the' before superlative degrees of adjectives.
- Rule 4: Use 'the' with ordinals.
- Rule 5: Use 'the' with words like 'king' or 'queen' (but not with names).
- Rule 6: Do not use 'the' when meaning something in general.
- Exceptions: No 'the' with continents, states, countries (except certain ones), cities, lakes.

## Key Terms
- **Determiners:** Words that introduce nouns.
- **Definite Article:** 'The' - refers to specific nouns.
- **Indefinite Articles:** 'A' and 'An' - refer to non-specific nouns.
