###### Objectives

```
After studying this unit, the students will be able to
```
- understand the fundamentals of sentence structure in English language
- acquaint yourself with all the parts of the sentence
- construct meaningful sentences so, it will no longer be an uphill task
- know about the different types of sentences,
- add variety to your written and spoken English with myriad kinds of sentences

###### Introduction

```
Sentences are the building blocks of every language. The study of syntax is crucial to the
understanding of different types of sentences, along with an overview of verb forms and the
knowledge of tense usage.
```
**What is a sentence?**

```
If you flip through the pages of the Oxford dictionary, a sentence refers to a set of words expressing
a statement, a question or an order. In simple words, a sentence is a meaningful collection of words.
```
```
Examples of sentences are as follows:
```
- I met him at a bookstore.
- She is late for the meeting.
- What a pleasant weather!
- Do you like tea?

Aneesha Pental, Lovely Prof essional University


- My friend is not diligent.

###### 1.1 How is a sentence different from a clause?

```
Look at the following set of words and try to spot the differences:
```
```
i. When he came here
ii. She is honest.
```
If you notice carefully, there are differences between (i) and (ii).

The former set of words is a clause while the latter set of words is a sentence.

```
Clause Sentence
```
It is a group of words having one subject and
one verb always.

```
It is a group of words having one or multiple
subjects and one or multiple verbs.
```
It may or may not be complete in itself. It is always complete in itself.

It is of two types:

- Independent clause
- Dependent clause

```
Based on the structure, it is of four types :
```
- Simple
- Compound
- Complex
- Compound Complex

Examples :

(a) When he came here

(b) if you do not eat

```
Examples:
```
```
(a) The children sing a song.
```
```
(b) She is beautiful.
```
###### 1.2 How is a sentence different from a phrase?

```
Look at the following set of words and spot the differences:
```
```
i. His tail between his legs
ii. On the table
iii. I believe in magic.
iv. The student is late for the class.
```
```
If you examine carefully, you will notice that (i), (ii) and (iii), (iv) differ in many ways.
```
```
The former sets of words refer to as phrases while the latter sets of words are defined as
sentences.
```
```
Phrase Sentence
```
```
It is a short group of words. It can be a short as well as a large group of
words.
```
```
It cannot stand on its own. It can stand on its own.
```
```
It has no grammatically accurate meaning. It has a completely grammatically accurate
meaning.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 01: Grammar
```
```
For example,
```
```
i. Fool’s paradise
ii. Flick of a wrist
```
```
For example,
```
```
i. I met him at a party.
ii. He is a diligent student.
```
###### 1.3 Basic Structure of a sentence

Subject + Predicate

For example, Children play in the ground.

↓ ↓

SUBJECT PREDICATE

```
A subject in the sentence can be a noun, pronoun, phrase and a clause.
```
A predicate in the sentence is the remaining part of the sentence

Children play in the ground.

↓ ↓

Subject Predicate

↓ ↓

NOUN play in the ground

↓ ↓

Verb Object

###### 1.4 Types of sentences

**Importance**

Before understanding the different types of sentences, you should be well acquainted with
the importance of learning about varieties of sentences. It is essential because they:

- add value to your academic answers
- help you experiment with the language
- leave an indelible imprint on the reader or the listener
- augment your grammatical skills
- foster effective communication in English language

**Based on the structure of the sentence, they are categorized into four**

**main types:**

1. Simple Sentence
2. Compound sentence
3. Complex Sentence
4. Compound Complex Sentence

###### 1.5 Simple sentence

Interestingly, it is not as simple as it sounds for you always have to follow the correct
grammatical structure.

A simple sentence has one independent clause.


```
↓
```
```
One Subject + One Verb
```
```
Following are the examples of simple sentences:
```
1. The train was late.
2. The child opened the door.
3. I am sorry.
4. He drives to work.
5. She is beautiful.
6. He is handsome.
7. I have two pet dogs.
8. Honesty is the best policy.
9. Sarah is my best friend.
10. Michael was late for the meeting.

```
Although most of the simple sentences have a subject and a verb, there are some
verbs which are complete sentences in themselves.
```
```
For example,
```
- Run!
- Listen!

###### 1.6 Compound sentence

```
A compound sentence has at least two independent clauses which are joined by
coordinating conjunctions like for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or by a semicolon.
Conjunctions are linking words that join parts of a sentence. A coordinating conjunction
is a word that joins two elements of equal grammatical rank and syntactic importance.
```
```
Following are the examples of Compound Sentences:
```
1. I want to see him soon, for he has been in Australia for two years.
2. The students finished the class and went for lunch.
3. He is a hard working student but he could not succeed.
4. He was suffering, yet he refused to see a doctor.
5. The whole town was flooded; people used boats.
6. She is quite affluent, yet she is miser.
7. My friend finally quit gambling because he ran out of money.
8. I never wrote him a letter, nor did I call him.
9. Sarah can travel by bus or travel by car.
10. I trusted him; however, he broke his promise.
11. I attended the meeting and went for lunch.
12. The table is made up of wood while the chair is made up of plastic.
13. Thomson reads novels and newspapers.
14. My friend likes to play basketball but I like playing football.
15. I prefer drinking tea; however, my husband likes coffee.

###### 1.7 Complex sentence

```
A complex sentence is the one that contains one independent clause and one or more
dependent clauses which are joined to each other by subordinating conjunctions. A
subordinating conjunction is a word or phrase that links a dependent clause to an
independent clause. This word or phrase indicates that a clause has informative value to
add to the sentence’s main idea, signaling a cause-and-effect relationship or a shift in time
and place between the two clauses.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 01: Grammar
```
```
Following are the examples of complex sentences:
```
1. Although my friend is intelligent, he could not pass with flying colors.
2. When my friends visit me, we have a gala time.
3. If he continues to disobey his parents, he will suffer in the future.
4. Many people enjoyed the film; however, Michael did not.
5. Unless you practice good hygiene, you cannot maintain good health.
6. If it continues to rain, I will miss the train.
7. Although his family was quite wealthy, he was still not content.
8. Whenever there is a hike in the fuel prices, people start using the public
    transport.
9. Take out the cake from the microwave when it develops a lustrous brown color.
10. If you had started the treatment on time, he would have been alive.

###### 1.8 Compound Complex sentence

A compound sentence combines the elements of both compound and complex sentences. Such kind
of a sentence is longer than other kinds of sentences. Hence, it needs to be punctuated correctly and
carefully. If the rules of punctuation are flouted, it can alter the meaning of the sentence.

You will always have an edge over others if you are well acquainted with the construction of a
compound complex sentence.

```
Following are the examples of a compound complex sentence:
```
1. Though James prefers watching football, he started enjoying cricket because he
    understood the rules of that sport.
2. Sarah received the invitation for the party but despite being disinterested in going, she
    chose to honor the invitation.
3. Her parents encouraged her to balance studies with extracurricular activities; however,
    they scolded her when she went on a trip with her friends.
4. My nephew does not like cartoons since they are loud, so he does not watch them.
5. Even though I was exhausted, I knew I had to accomplish the task, so I worked on the
    project even at night.
6. Usually I go for a walk every morning while the sun rises, but it was raining cats and dogs
    today.
7. My cousin likes to doze off in the afternoon but she can stay awake if she has some work
    deadlines to meet.
8. My pet dog jumped onto the couch and started playing with the TV remote just when I
    was reaching for the remote control.
9. The temperature has soared and it’s humid outside, so stay hydrated.
10. When I grow up, I want to become a doctor and serve the mankind.

###### 1.9 Transformation of sentences

Transformation of sentences refers to the conversion of sentences from one kind to another. This
exercise will eliminate your doubts and help you understand the various types of sentences in a
comprehensive manner.


**Simple to Compound sentence**

1. Besides being intelligent, she is diligent. (Simple)
    She is not only intelligent but also diligent. (Compound)
2. Despite being poor, he is content. (Simple)
    He is poor but content. (Compound)

**Simple to Complex sentence**

1. His opinion did not matter. (Simple)

1. Get two dresses and get one free. (Compound)

```
If you get two dresses, you get one free.(Complex)
```
2. You will have to hurry or you will miss the train. (Compound)
    If you do not hurry, you will miss the train.(Complex)

```
```

```
2. He is too weak to handle the situation. (Simple)
    He is very weak so he cannot handle the situation. (Compound)

###### Summary

```
A sentence is a meaningful collection of words. A sentence differs from a clause and a phrase.
A clause can be further divided into a dependent clause and an independent clause. A phrase
cannot stand on its own. It is imperative to study the different kinds of sentences. Based on the
structure, there are four types of sentences. A simple sentence has one subject and one verb. A
verb takes different forms like present, past and future in different sentences but it does not
change the structure of the sentence. A compound sentence has two independent clauses
joined by coordinating conjunctions. A complex sentence has one independent clause and
dependent clause joined by subordinating conjunctions. A compound-complex sentence has
both the elements of a compound and a complex sentence.
```
###### Key words

- Conjunction: Conjunctions are words that link other words, phrases or clauses together.
- Coordinating Conjunctions: Coordinating conjunctions are words that join words, phrases
    and clauses of equal grammatical rank in a sentence.

Examples of coordinating conjunctions include for, and, nor, but, or, yet and so.

- Correlative Conjunctions: Correlative conjunctions are referred to as a pair of conjunctions
    that are always said together or used in combination.
    Examples of correlative conjunctions include either/or, neither/ nor, not only/ but also.

English Communication Skills


```
Unit 01: Grammar
```
- Subordinating Conjunctions: A subordinating conjunction is a word or phrase that links a
    dependent clause to an independent clause. This word or phrase indicates that a clause
    has informative value to add to the sentence’s main idea, signaling a cause-and-effect
    relationship or a shift in time and place between the two clauses.

```
Examples of Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, as if, as long as, as much
as, as soon as, before, even though, even if, only, since, unless, until, till, when, whenever,
whereas, while etcetera.

###### Objectives

```
After studying this unit, you will be able to:
```
- become efficient in the use of articles of English grammar
- realize how these articles appear quite simple yet their usage is cumbersome
- write and speak grammatically correct sentences without any flaws in the usage of articles
- employ ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’ in your English sentences without feeling perplexed
- acquaint yourself with the general rules of using articles along with introduction to certain
    exceptions

###### Introduction

###### 2.1 What are Articles?

```
Articles fall under the category of determiners in English grammar. They are used in the beginning
of a noun phrase in a sentence.
```
```
They are further divided into two types:
```
```
(a) Definite Articles
```
```
(b) Indefinite Articles
```
###### 2.2 What are the differences between indefinite and definite articles?

```
Indefinite Articles Definite Articles
```
```
They are used with singular countable nouns. They are used with all nouns whether
countable or uncountable and singular or
plural.
```
```
They are used for a non specific person or a
thing.
```
```
They are used for specific people or things.
```
Aneesha Pental, Lovely Prof essional University


```
They are used while talking about something or
someone in general.
```
```
They are used while talking about something
and someone in particular.
```
```
‘A’ and ‘an’ are the indefinite articles. ‘The’ is the definite article.
```
###### 2.3 Rules for using ‘a’ and ‘an’ in English language

```
Rule 1: It is imperative to use a/an before a singular common noun.
```
```
If you do not follow this rule, then the text written or spoken in English will be both grammatically
inaccurate and incomplete.
```
```
For example,
```
1. He carried a bag to the school.
2. I have a pen.
3. My friend lent me a book.
4. The child was excited to see an airplane.
5. Sarah ate an egg for breakfast.
6. The child saw a dog.
7. She is just creating an issue.
8. My room was a mess.
9. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
10. My father is an inspiration for me.

```
Rule 2: We use the article ‘a’ before the words that begin with a consonant sound.
```
```
What is a consonant sound?
According to the Cambridge English dictionary, it is a speech sound produced by human beings
when the breath that flows out through the mouth is blocked by the teeth, tongue, or lips.
Except for the vowels in English – a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y – all the letters are consonants.
```
```
Look at following examples.
```
1. She is a photographer by profession.
2. The parents gifted a toy to their child.
3. The girl carried a basket of fruits.
4. Max gave a beautiful watch to his sister.
5. Maria bought a red dress for herself.
6. He is a good boy.
7. She is a beautiful girl.
8. I have a basket of fruits.
9. I have bought a new water bottle.
10. The child threw a stone in the pond.

```
Rule 3: We use the article ‘an’ before the words that begin with a vowel sound.
What is a vowel sound?
According to the Cambridge English dictionary, it is a speech sound produced by human beings
when the breath flows out through the mouth without being blocked by the teeth, tongue or lips.
The vowels in English are a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 02: Grammar
```
```
Look at the following examples.
```
1. Mary carried an umbrella to the school.
2. Her friend is an obedient woman.
3. I do not have an iota of doubt in his abilities.
4. The child was scared to see an eagle in the sky.
5. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
6. It was an astounding revelation.
7. My sister is an amazing dancer.
8. The teacher demanded an answer from the student.
9. She put the letter in an envelope.
10. My parents played an instrumental role in my success.

Observe the following sentences:

1. The child had a box of chocolates.
2. He is an honest person.
    1. Even though chocolates denote a plural noun, we have used ‘a’ because box
       denotes a singular noun.

```
You might say that the ‘h’ is a consonant but when you carefully listen to
the
```
```
Pronunciation of ‘honest’, you will hear the vowel sound.
```
2. You might say that the ‘h’ is a consonant but when you carefully listen to the
    pronunciation of ‘honest’, you will hear the vowel sound.

```
Observe the following sentences:
```
1. He is honest.
2. She is beautiful.
3. She works efficiently.
4. He is swimming.
5. I admire him.

You might wonder as to why we have not used any articles in the previous sentences. The
reasons are as follows:

- In the 1st sentence and 2nd sentence, honest and beautiful are adjectives and not noun
    phrases.
- In the 3rd sentence, ‘efficiently’ is an adverb and not a noun phrase.
- In the 4th sentence, swimming is a verb and not a noun phrase.
- In the 5th sentence, ‘him’ is a pronoun and not a noun phrase.

```
Hence, we use the articles ‘a’ and ‘an’ only before a noun phrase.
```

###### 2.4 Rules for using ‘the’ in English language

```
Rule 1: We use ‘the’ when we mean something in particular.
```
```
The examples are as follows:
```
1. I like your garden. The flowers are beautiful.

```
(The flowers = the flowers in your garden, not flowers in general)
```
2. All the students in the class like their teacher.

```
(the students = the students in that particular class)
```
```
Rule 2: ‘The’ is used with the names of rivers, seas, oceans, bays, banks, hotels, musical instruments, mountain
ranges, municipal or government departments, substances in particular sense.
```
```
The examples are as follows:
```
1. Rivers : The Ganges , The Amazon
2. Seas : The Red sea, The Black sea
3. Oceans : The Pacific ocean, The Atlantic ocean, The Indian ocean
4. Bays : The Bay of Bengal
5. Banks : The State Bank of India
6. Hotels : The California hotel, The Leila, Mount View, Shivalik View
7. Musical Instruments : the piano, the guitar, the violin
8. Mountain Ranges: The Aravalli
9. Municipal or government departments : The Ministry of defense, The Sydney Opera House
10. Substances in particular sense: The gold mined here is of poor quality.

```
Rule 3: ‘The’ is used before the superlative degree of the adjective.
```
```
The examples are as follows:
```
1. She is the best in her field.
2. India is the second largest country in the world.
3. Sarah scored the highest marks in the class.
4. Oscar is the tallest boy in his class.
5. My friend is one of the most intelligent students in her group.
6. She is one of the most beautiful women I have ever met.
7. My friend is the most efficient teacher in the school.
8. He cooks the most delicious lasagna.
9. He was successful in solving one of the most difficult problems.
10. He ate the smallest portion of the pizza.

```
Rule 4: We use ‘the’ with ordinals.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 02: Grammar
```
```
The examples are as follows:
```
1. Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on the moon.
2. We had to walk up to the sixth floor of the building as the elevator broke down.
3. He is the first doctor in his family.
4. The restaurant was on the second floor of the mall.
5. I could not reach the top floor of the hotel.

_Rule 5: We use ‘the’ with words like ‘king’ or ‘queen’._

```
However, we do not use ‘the’ if the word ‘king’ or ‘queen’ is followed b the name of the
king or the queen.
```
For example,

1. The king ruled in favor of the masses.
2. Queen Victoria ruled over England for 63 years.

_Rule 6: We do not use ‘the’ when we mean something or someone in general._

For example,

1. Flowers are beautiful. (flowers = not any particular group of flowers)
2. I am afraid of dogs. (dogs = not any dogs in particular)
3. Do you collect stamps? (stamps = not any stamps in particular )

_Rule 6: We do not say ‘the’ with the names of continents._

```
For example, it is Africa and not the Africa, Europe and not the Europe, North America
and not the North America.
```
_Rule 7: We do not usually use ‘the’ names of states and countries._

```
For example, France, Japan, Nigeria, Australia, India, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh
```
```
However, we use ‘the’ with the names that includ , ‘kingdom’, ‘republic’, ‘states’.
```
```
For example, The Unites States of America, The United Kingdom, The People’s Republic
of China.
```
_Rule 8: We do not use ‘the’ with the names of cities, towns or villages._

```
Exception: The Hague (in the Netherlands)
```
_Rule 9: We do not use ‘the’ with the names of lakes._

_For example, Lake Victoria._


```
Exception: Although we use ‘the’ with names of the regions, for example, the Middle
East, the Far East, but we say northern France, western Canada.
```
```
Since the difference between ‘something in general’ and ‘something is particular’ is not
always apparent, we can observe the following examples to understand it well.
```
```
The examples are as follows:

###### Objectives

```
After studying this unit, you will be able to:
```
- understand the basics of English grammar and composition
- strengthen your foundation to improve written and spoken English
- focus on the practical application of all parts of speech along with their theoretical
    definitions
- eliminate all types of doubts and problems you face while communicating in English

###### Introduction

###### 3.1 What are Parts of Speech?

```
Words are divided into different kinds or classes, called Parts of Speech, according to their use, that
is according to the work they do in a sentence. Each part of speech performs a unique function
which helps to establish its identity.
```
```
Following are the eight parts of speech:
```
1. Noun
2. Pronoun
3. Verb
4. Adverb
5. Adjective
6. Prepositions
7. Conjunctions

Aneesha Pental, Lovely Prof essional University


8. Interjections

###### 3.2 Nouns

```
A noun is a word used as the name of a person, place or thing.
```
```
For example,
```
1. The sun is blazing hot.
2. He gave me a flower.
3. She filled the bottle with water.

```
In the definition of noun, the word ‘thing’ includes
```
1. all objects that we can see, hear, taste, touch or smell
2. something that we can think of but cannot perceive by the senses.

**Types of Nouns:**

```
Nouns are divided into following different types:
```
1. Common Noun
2. Proper Noun
3. Collective Noun
4. Abstract Noun

**Common Noun:**

```
A common noun is a name given in common to every person or thing of the same class or kind.
(Common here means shared by all) For example, words like city, bus, school, pen, paper, book et
cetera.
```
```
Let’s have a look at the examples:
```
1. I met a boy at the library.
2. Cups are placed on the table.
3. I ate an orange in the morning.
4. My mother asked me to buy a new bag.
5. I carried a basket of fruits.

**Proper Noun**

```
A proper noun is the name of some particular person or place. (Proper means one’s own. Hence, a
proper noun is a person’s own name).
```
- Proper nouns are always written with Upper case (Capital) letters in the beginning.
    For example, Sarah and Jacob are childhood friends.
- Proper nouns are sometimes used as common nouns.
    For example, Kalidas is often called the Shakespeare of India.
    (Shakespeare is the greatest dramatist.)

```
Let’s have a look at the examples :
```
1. _India_ is the seventh largest country in the world.
2. _Jessica_ studies at a university.
_3. Nate_ went on a trip to _Delhi._
4. The _Taj Mahal_ is a symbol of grandeur.
_5. Jaipur_ is called the pink city of _India._

```
In the above examples, the italicized words belong to the group of proper nouns.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 03: Grammar
```
**Collective Noun**

A collective noun is the name of a number (or collection ) of persons or things taken together or
spoken as one whole as crowd, mob, flock , herd, army , fleet et cetera.

```
Look at the following examples:
```
1. The fisherman caught a _shoal_ of fish.
2. A _herd_ of cattle was grazing in the field.
3. The _choir_ sang a melodious song.
4. I gave a _bouquet_ of flowers to my friend.
5. A _troupe_ of dancers was invited to perform in the cruise.

In the above examples, the italicized words belong to the group of collective noun.

**Abstract Nouns**

An abstract noun is usually the name of a quality, action or state considered apart from the

object to which it belongs, as:

- Quality: Goodness, kindness, whiteness, darkness, honesty, wisdom, bravery
- Action : Laughter, theft, movement, judgment, hatred
- State : Childhood, boyhood, slavery, sleep, poverty

Abstract Nouns are formed

- From Adjectives

As ‘kindness’ from ‘kind’, ‘honesty’ from honest.

- From Verbs

As ‘obedience’ from ‘obey’

- From Common Nouns

As ‘childhood’ from child, ‘slavery’ from ‘slave’

```
Look at the following examples:
```
1. _Honesty_ is the best policy.
2. _Friendship_ is one of the greatest virtues of _mankind_.
3. The boy took many stupid decisions in his _youth_.
4. _Beauty_ is in the eyes of the beholder.
5. The soldier received many accolades for his _bravery_.

In the above examples, the italicized words belong to the group of abstract nouns.

**The nouns can be classified into two types on the basis of number:**

1. Countable nouns
2. Uncountable nouns

**Countable nouns** (or countables) are the names of objects, people, etc that we can count

For example: book, pen, paper, table, bottle etc.

**Uncountable nouns** (or uncountables) are the names of things which we cannot count. They mainly
denote substances and abstract things. For example: oil, sugar, honey, honesty etc.

###### 3.3 Pronouns

A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun. Since we cannot repeat the nouns in a sentence and
further, in a paragraph, we have to substitute it with the pronouns.


```
Look at the following examples:
```
```
John is absent because he is ill.
```
```
The books are where you left them.
```
```
The italicized words are referred to as pronouns.
```
**Types of Pronouns**

**Personal Pronouns**

```
They are used to substitute people or things. They can be either singular or plural, depending
whether they refer to one or multiple nouns.
```
```
For example, ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘we’ and ‘us’
```
```
They are either the subject of the sentence or the object. They have different forms for they perform
different functions in a sentence.
```
```
Look at the following examples
```
```
If the writer is referring to himself/ herself in a sentence, it is written or said using ‘I’ if he/ she is
in the subject position.
```
```
For example, I met my friend at the restaurant.
```
```
In the above example, ‘I’ is the subject of the sentence.
```
```
If he/she is in the object position- My friend met me at the restaurant.
```
```
In the above example, ‘me’ is the object of the sentence.
```
**Possessive pronouns**

```
They indicate possession of something besides being personal pronouns.
```
```
For example, ‘my’, ‘mine’, ‘our’ et cetera
```
```
Observe the following sentences:
```
```
a. My car is red in color.
b. The brown bag is mine.
c. It is our responsibility to preserve our environment.
```
**Relative Pronouns**

```
Relative pronouns are the ones that begin with a clause. The examples include ‘who’, ‘that’, ‘which’.
They can also fall into the group of other kinds of pronouns.
```
```
For example,
```
1. I watched the film that you had recommended.
2. Sarah is the one who likes eating chocolates the most.

**Reflexive pronouns**

```
Reflexive pronouns: When a subject performs an action on itself, the sentence uses a reflexive
pronoun after the verb. Reflexive pronouns include: myself, himself, themselves, and herself.
```
```
For example,
```
1. He did the homework himself.
2. She choreographed the performance herself.
3. He bought himself a new tablet.

English Communication Skills


```
Unit 03: Grammar
```
4. I have told that myself a couple of times.
5. We must realize our responsibility towards climate change ourselves.

**Intensive Pronouns**

They are similar to reflexive pronouns, however, they perform a different function in a sentence. It
is not a significant part of a sentence and is only used to emphasize its antecedent.

For example,

1. I myself like a little stroll after dinner.
2. We went to hear the man himself speak.
3. The author approved the book cover herself.

**Indefinite Pronouns**

Like personal pronouns, indefinite pronouns refer to people or things, but they don’t have a
specific person or thing to reference.

Examples of indefinite pronouns include some, anyone, and everything.

**Demonstrative pronouns**

They point out or modify a person or thing. There are four demonstrative pronouns:

This and that (for singular words)

These and those (for plural words)

**Interrogative pronouns**

Interrogative pronouns begin questions.

For example, in “Who are you, the interrogative pronoun ‘who’ starts the question. There are five
interrogative pronouns: who, whom and whose (for questions that involve people),
and which and what (for questions that involve things).

**Reciprocal pronouns**

Reciprocal pronouns are similar to reflexive pronouns, but they involve groups of two or more that
perform the same action with one another. There are only two reciprocal pronouns: each other (for
groups of two) and one another (for larger groups).

**Distributive pronouns**

A distributive pronoun refers to one person, animal, or thing at a time. These pronouns
include each, neither, and either, which should be paired with plural nouns and singular verbs.

Here’s one example:

Each of the dogs had a bath today.

Or

Neither of the packages arrived on time.

###### 3.4 Verbs

A verb is a word used to express action or state; as


1. The girl _wrote_ a letter to her cousin.
2. Kolkata _is_ a big city.
3. Iron and copper _are_ useful metals.

```
A verb is the part of a sentence that tells us what the subject performs. Verbs are the hearts of
English sentences.
```
**Types of Verbs**

**Finite Verbs**

```
They are the actual verbs which are called the roots of sentences. It is a form of a verb that is
performed by or refers to a subject and uses one of the twelve forms of tense and changes according
to the number/person of the subject.
```
```
For example,
```
```
Alex went to school.
```
```
(Subject – Alex – performed the action in the past. This information is evident only by the verb
‘went’.)
```
**Non finite Verbs**

```
They are not actual verbs. They do not work as verbs in the sentence rather they work as nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, etc. Non-finite verbs do not change according to the number/person of the
subject because these verbs, also called verbals, do not have any direct relation to the subject.
Sometimes they become the subject themselves.
```
```
The forms of non-finite verbs are – infinitive, gerund, and participle (participles become finite verbs
when they take auxiliary verbs.)
```
**Action Verbs**

```
They indicate what the subject of a sentence performs. Action verbs can make the listener/reader
feel emotions, see scenes more vividly and accurately.
```
```
Action verbs can be transitive or intransitive.
```
**Transitive Verbs**

```
They must have a direct object. A transitive verb demands something/someone to be acted upon.
```
```
For example,
```
```
I painted the car. (The verb ‘paint’ demands an object to be painted)
```
**Intransitive Verbs**

```
They do not act upon anything. They may be followed by an adjective, adverb, preposition, or
another part of speech.
```
```
For example:
```
```
She smiled. (The verb ‘smile’ cannot have any object since the action of ‘smiling’ does not
fall upon anything/anyone)
```
```
I wake up at 6 AM. (No object is needed for this verb)
```
**Linking Verbs**

```
A linking verb adds details about the subject of a sentence. In its simplest form, it connects the
subject and the complement — that is, the words that follow the linking verb. It creates a link
between them instead of showing action. Often, what is on each side of a linking verb is equivalent;
the complement redefines or restates the subject. Generally, linking verbs are called ‘be’
verbs which are - am, is, are, was, were. However, there are some other verbs which can work as
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 03: Grammar
```
linking verbs. Those verbs are: act, feel, remain, appear, become, seem, smell, sound, grow, look,
prove, stay, taste, turn.

Some verbs in this list can also be action verbs. To figure out if they are linking verbs, you should
try replacing them with forms of the ‘be’ verbs. If the changed sentence makes sense, that verb is a
linking verb.

```
For example,
```
1. She _appears_ ready for the game. (She is ready for the game.)
2. The food _seemed_ delicious. (The food was delicious.)
3. You _look_ happy. (You are happy.)

**Auxiliary Verbs**

Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs. An auxiliary verb extends the main verb by helping to
show time, tense, and possibility. The auxiliary verbs are – be verbs, have, and do. They are used in
the continuous (progressive) and perfect tenses.

```
Linking verbs work as main verbs in the sentence, but auxiliary verbs help main verbs.
```
‘Do’ is an auxiliary verb that is used to ask questions, to express negation, to provide emphasis, and
more.

Examples:

1. Alex is going to school.
2. They are walking in the park.
3. I have seen a movie.
4. Do you drink tea?
5. Don’t waste your time.
6. Please, do submit your assignments.

**Modal Verbs**

A modal verb is a kind of an auxiliary verb. It assists the main verb to indicate possibility,
potentiality, ability, permission, expectation, and obligation. The modal verbs are can, could, must,
may, might, ought to, shall, should, will, would.

Examples,

1. I may want to talk to you again.
2. They must play their best game to win.
3. She should call him.
4. I will go there.

###### 3.5 Adverbs

An adverb is a word or phrase that modifies or qualifies an adjective, verb, or other adverb or a
word group, expressing a relation of place, time, circumstance, manner, cause, degree, etc.
(e.g., gently, quite, then, there ).

```
For example,
```
-


- Abruptly: I thought the movie ended abruptly.
- Beautifully: The beautifully painted landscape is a wonderful addition to my living room
    decor.
- Delicately: Grandma's crystal vase is a priceless antique that must be handled delicately.
- Delightfully: Her outfit showcased her delightfully quirky personality.
- Firmly: The teacher firmly disciplined the students for their misbehavior.
- Lightly: She lightly dusted the brownies with a layer of powdered sugar before serving.
- Truthfully: She truthfully answered the police officer's questions.
- Quickly: Quickly finish the grocery shopping so we can get to the party in time.
- Wearily: At the end of a long day, she wearily headed to bed.
- Willfully: I sent my son to bed early for willfully refusing to eat his vegetables.

```
Adverbs tell us how it happened
```
1. Briskly: Kristen briskly walked to the library, eager to complete her homework.
2. Brutally: It was brutally clear he was not interested in hearing my opinion.
3. Cheerfully: April cheerfully greeted Mark each morning.
4. Expertly: Adam expertly maneuvered the components of the machine into their proper
    positions.
5. Randomly: I love to randomly share interesting trivia with my friends and family.

```
Adverbs tell us where it happened

1. Downstairs: The public library often holds meetings downstairs.
2. Everywhere: Jack looked everywhere for his missing keys.
3. Here: She will plant her garden here.
4. In: We stayed in to watch a movie instead of attending the party.
5. Inside: When it's hot and humid, Anna likes to read inside.

```
Adverbs tell when it happened
```
1. Early: She arrived early for the meeting.
2. First: When I bake, I make cookies first.
3. Last: When I clean, I do laundry last.
4. Later: I will stop by later to see how you are doing.
5. Never: He never wants to go to the park with me.

```
Adverbs tell the extent of Action
```
1. Almost: I almost stopped at McDonald's for lunch, but I was running late.
2. Also: A talented singer, Jamie also enjoys playing the saxophone.
3. Enough: Daniel is finally tall enough to ride the roller coaster.
4. Only: I only take the bus to work on Mondays.
5. Not: He is not running that race today.

```
Adverbs are Intensifiers
```
1. He literally wrecked his car.
2. I am certain of the facts, for sure.

```
Unit 03: Grammar
```
3. You simply don't understand.
4. I really don't care what you think.
5. I heartily endorsed the new restaurant.

###### 3.6 Adjectives

It is a word that describes a noun or pronoun. Adjectives are one of the four major word classes,
along with nouns, verbs and adverbs.

Examples of adjectives are: big, small, blue, old, rich and nice. They give us more information about
people, animals or things represented by nouns and pronouns.

The three degrees of an adjective are positive, comparative and superlative.

A positive adjective is a normal adjective that’s used to describe, not compare.

```
For example: “This is good soup” and “I am funny.”
```
A comparative adjective is an adjective that’s used to compare two things (and is often followed by
the word than).

```
For example: “This soup is better than that salad” or “I am funnier than her.”
```
A superlative adjective is an adjective that’s used to compare three or more things, or to state that
something is the most.

```
For example: “This is the best soup in the whole world” or “I am the funniest out of all the
other bloggers.”
```
```
These three degrees only work for descriptive adjectives.
```
```
If a descriptive adjective has one or two syllables, you can turn it into its comparative and
superlative forms by adding - er and - est.
```
**Types of Adjectives**

**_Descriptive Adjectives_** : A descriptive adjective is probably what you think of when you hear the
word “adjective.” Descriptive adjectives are used to describe nouns and pronouns. Words
like beautiful, cute, silly, tall, annoying, loud and nice are all descriptive adjectives. These adjectives
add information and qualities to the words they’re modifying.

**_Examples:_**

“The flowers have a smell” is just stating a fact, and it has no adjectives to describe what the
flowers or their smell are like.

“The beautiful flowers have a nice smell” gives us a lot more information, with two descriptive
adjectives.

You can say “The cat is hungry,” or “The hungry cat.” In both cases, the word hungry is an
adjective describing the cat.

**_Quantitative Adjectives_**

They describe the quantity of something. In other words, they answer the question “how much?” or
“how many?” Numbers like one and thirty are this type of adjective. So are more general words
like many, half and a lot.

**_Examples:_**

1. “How many children do you have?” “I only have one daughter.”
2. “Do you plan on having more kids?” “Oh yes, I want many children!”


3. “I can’t believe I ate that whole cake!”

```
Demonstrative Adjectives
```
```
A demonstrative adjective describes “which” noun or pronoun you’re referring to. These adjectives
include the words:
```
1. This — Used to refer to a singular noun close to you.
2. That — Used to refer to a singular noun far from you.
3. These — Used to refer to a plural noun close to you.
4. Those — Used to refer to a plural noun far from you.

```
Examples:
```
1. “Which bicycle is yours?” “This bicycle is mine, and that one used to be mine until I
    sold it.”
2. This shark is pregnant.
3. That lady looks worried.
4. Take these ones away.
5. Put those tins in the cupboard.

```
Possessive Adjectives
```
```
They describe to whom a thing belongs. Some of the most common possessive adjectives include:
```
1. My — Belonging to me
2. His — Belonging to him
3. Her — Belonging to her
4. Their — Belonging to them
5. Your — Belonging to you

```
Interrogative Adjectives
```
```
Interrogate, meaning that they ask a question. These adjectives are always followed by a noun or a
pronoun, and are used to form questions. The interrogative adjectives are:
```
1. Which — Asks to make a choice between options.
2. What — Asks to make a choice (in general).
3. Whose — Asks who something belongs to.

```
Other question words, like “who” or “how,” aren’t adjectives since they don’t modify
nouns. For example, you can say “whose coat is this?” but you can’t say “who coat?”
```
```
Which, what and whose are only considered adjectives if they’re immediately followed by
a noun. The word which is an adjective in this sentence: “Which color is your favorite?”
But not in this one: “Which is your favorite color?”
```
```
Distributive Adjectives
```
```
They describe specific members out of a group. These adjectives are used to single out one or more
individual items or people. Some of the most common distributive adjectives include:
```
1. Each — Every single one of a group (used to speak about group members individually).
2. Every — Every single one of a group (used to make generalizations).
3. Either — One between a choice of two.
4. Neither — Not one or the other between a choice of two.
5. Any — One or some things out of any number of choices. This is also used when the
    choice is irrelevant, like: “it doesn’t matter, I’ll take _any_ of them.”

English Communication Skills


```
Unit 03: Grammar
```
```
These adjectives are always followed by the noun or pronoun they’re modifying.
```
**_Examples_**

1. Every rose has its thorn.”
2. “Which of these two songs do you like?” “I don’t like either song.”
3. Either of these movies would be interesting to me.
4. Either title is age-appropriate, but I suggest the former.
5. Neither pen will do, as I need to sign in pencil.

**_Articles_**

Although articles are their own part of speech, they’re technically also adjectives. Articles are used
to describe which noun you’re referring to.

1. A—A singular, general item.
2. An —A singular, general item. Use this before words that start with a vowel.
3. The —A singular or plural, specific item.

Simply put, when you’re talking about something general, use a and an. When you’re speaking
about something specific, use the. “A cat” can be used to refer to any cat in the world. “The cat” is
used to refer to the cat that just walked by.

###### 3.7 Conjunctions

A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, and clauses to construct a sentence.

1. Sarah and Max are childhood friends.
2. Do you like tea or coffee?
3. Although she is diligent, she could not get a good score.

**Types of Conjunctions**

**_Coordinating Conjunctions_**

The job of a coordinating conjunction is to join two words, phrases, or independent clauses, which
are parallel in structure. There are seven coordinating conjunctions which are by far the most
common conjunctions: and, but, for, nor, or, so, yet.

```
For example,
```
```
We went to the stadium and enjoyed the cricket match.
```
```
Do you want an ice cream or chocolate?
```
**_Correlative Conjunctions_**

A correlative conjunction uses a set of words in a parallel sentence structure to show a contrast or
to compare the equal parts of a sentence. The words of correlative conjunctions have a special
connection between them. The correlative conjunctions are not only - but also, either- or, neither -
nor, both - and, not - but, whether - or.

**_Subordinating Conjunctions_**

A subordinating conjunction joins elements of an unparallel sentence structure. These elements are
usually a dependent clause and an independent clause.

###### 3.8 Prepositions

```
It is a word in grammar that is used before a noun, a noun phrase, or a pronoun, connecting it to
another word. We commonly use prepositions to show a relationship in space or time or a logical
relationship between two or more people, places or things.
```
```
Prepositions are most followed by a noun phrase or pronoun.
```
```
Prepositions explain relationships of sequence, space, and logic between the object of the sentence
and the rest of the sentence. They help us understand order, time connections, and positions.
```
**Types of Prepositions**

```
Prepositions of time : They show the relationship of time between the nouns to the other parts of
a sentence.
```
```
On, at, in, from, to, for, since, ago, before, till/until, by, etc. are the most common prepositions of
time.
```
```
For example,
```
1. I started working at 10 AM.
2. I’ll see her on Friday.
3. I will get a holiday in December.
4. I worked there from 2010 to 2017.
5. They will not return until Friday.
6. Alex has been in the village since Sunday.
7. I will work with them for a year.
8. I want to leave before lunch.
9. I want to leave after lunch.
10. They don’t talk during dinner.

```
Prepositions of place : They show the relationship of place between the nouns to the other parts
of a sentence.
```
```
Common prepositions of places & direction: On, at, in, by, from, to, towards, up, down, across,
between, among, through, in front of, behind, above, over, under, below, etc. are the most common.
```
```
Prepositions of Agents or Things : They indicate a casual relationship between nouns and other
parts of the sentence.
```
```
Of, for, by, with, about, etc. are the most used and common prepositions of agents or things.
```
```
Phrasal Prepositions : A phrasal preposition is not a prepositional phrase, but they are a
combination of two or more words which functions as a preposition.
```
```
For example,
```
```
Along with, apart from, because of, by means of, according to, in front of, contrary to, in
spite of, on account of, in reference to, in addition to, in regard to, instead of, on top of, out
of, with regard to, etc. are the most common phrasal prepositions.

###### 3.9 Interjections

It is a word or phrase that is used as a short, sudden expression of emotion.

```
For example,
```
```
Hey!" "Ouch!" and "Cut that out!" are interjections.
```
**Rules for using Interjections:**

**_Rule 1:_** Interjections express a sudden mood, emotions, and feeling with emphasis. There are also
many taboo words that are usually used in everyday conversation but not in formal aspects. These
words fall into the category of interjections.

Examples,

1. Wow! That’s an amazing scene.
2. Aw, I did not want him to come

**_Rule 2:_** Some interjections interrupt a conversation or a thought or hold someone’s attention for a
moment. These are just sounds, not words because these sounds do not make any sense.

Examples,

1. Your, um, shirt has a stain on the back.
2. I want to, uh, ask you out on a date.

**_Rule 3: Some interjections express only yes or no._**

Examples,

1. Yes! I will most definitely do it.
2. Nah, we are not going.

**_Rule 4: Some interjections are used to get someone’s attention._**

Examples,

1. Yo, Alex! Get in the car!
2. Hey! Will you give me that ball?

**_Examples of Interjections for Greeting:_**

1. Hi! How is your health now?
2. Hello! How are you, Peter?
3. Hey! Where are you going?
4. Hi! How’s your business going on?

**_Examples of Interjections for Joy:_**

1. Hurray! My team has won the tournament.
2. Wow! The scenery is so eye-catching.
3. Yippee! We are going for a picnic.
4. Hurray! I have won the first prize.

**_Examples of Interjections for Surprise:_**

1. What! You have broken the showpiece.
2. Eh! You have done a mess.
3. Ah! What have you done?
4. Oh! What a hot and humid day!

**_Examples of Interjections for Grief/Pain:_**

1. Ah! Our team lost the match.


2. Alas! John’s father died yesterday.
3. Ouch! I hurt my ankle.
4. What a pity! You have lost your tab

```
Examples of Interjections for Approval
```
1. Bravo! John has taken a wicket.
2. Well done! You have done a good job.
3. Brilliant! Your article is so helpful.
4. Splendid! I like your work.

###### Summary

```
There are eight parts of speech in English grammar. Each part performs a distinct function. English
grammar and composition is incomplete without the usage of parts of speech. Interestingly, there
are some words in English language which perform the function of two different parts of speech. A
noun refers to a name given to any person, place and thing. A pronoun is used in place of a noun in
a sentence. A verb is referred to action performed in a sentence. An adverb helps to modify the verb
in a sentence. Adjectives qualify nouns and pronouns in a sentence. Conjunctions link the two
words or clauses in a sentence. Prepositions join the two parts in a sentence. Interjections are the
words used to express emotions.

###### Introduction

```
As they say, ‘To err is human’, it is absolutely normal to commit mistakes in English grammar. In

grammar.

**_Explanation_**

Misplaced apostrophes: Apostrophes are not difficult to use once you know how, but putting them
in the wrong place is one of the most common grammar mistakes in the English language. Many
people use an apostrophe to form the plural of a word, particularly if the word in question ends in
a vowel, which might make the word look strange with an S added to make it plural.

1. We could’ve gone there today.
2. I would have done it sooner.
3. You should’ve said.

**_Explanation:_**

This common mistake arises because the contracted forms of ‘should have’, ‘could have’ and
‘would have’ sound a bit like should of, could of and would of. This mistake is made across all
these kinds of words.

```
The correct answers are:
```
1. Whom shall I invite?
2. Who is responsible?
3. He was the only person who wanted to help me.

```
1. ‘Who’ refers to the subject in a sentence and ‘whom’ refers to the object in a sentence.
2. ‘Who’ and ‘whom’ work in the same way as ‘he’ and ‘him’ or ‘she’ and ‘her’.
3. In the sentence, ‘Who is responsible?’, the answer could be He/ she is responsible. Hence,
    ‘who ‘should be used.
4. In the sentence, ‘Whom shall I invite?’, the answer could be ‘You should invite him/ her. ‘
    Hence, ‘whom’ fits perfectly in this interrogative sentence.
5. In the last sentence, it should be noted that we use ‘who’ or ‘whom’ while referring to a
    person and ‘that’ while referring to things.

2. We use ‘since’ in the present perfect to describe an action or situation that began in the
    past and continues in the present.
3. We use ‘for’ with a period of time.
4. We use ‘from’ when we are talking about a finished point in time which is not specified.
5. For example, we don’t know which two days the speaker is referring to in the sentence.

After studying this unit, you will be able to:
```
- acknowledge that listening is not a passive activity
- understand that listening skills significantly contribute to effective communication skills
- establish key differences between hearing and listening

###### Introduction

###### 5.1 What are listening skills?

```
As per the Oxford dictionary, listening refers to the ability to pay attention to and effectively
interpret what other people are saying. “Listening is a skill that we’re in danger of losing in a world
of digital distraction and information overload”, writes Seth S. Horowitz in ‘The Science and Art of
Listening.’ He continues, “And yet we dare not lose it because listening tunes our brain to the
patterns of our environment faster than any other sense, and paying attention to the non visual
parts of our world feeds into everything from our intellectual sharpness to our dance skills.”
```
```
“You never listen!” is not just the complaint of a problematic relationship; it has also become an
epidemic in a world that is exchanging convenience for content, speed for meaning. The richness of
life doesn’t lie in the loudness and the beat, but in the timbres and the variations that you can
discern if you simply pay attention.
```
```
In the words of Stephen R Covey, “Most people do not listen with the intent to understand,
they listen with the intent to reply”.
```

###### 5.2 What are the differences between hearing and listening?

```
Hearing Listening
```
1. Hearing refers to one’s ability to
    perceive sounds, by receiving
    vibrations through ears.
       1. Listening is something done
          consciously, that involves the
          understanding and analysis of the
          sounds you hear.
2. It is ability.
    2. It is a skill.
3. It is of a primary and continuous
    nature.
       3. It is of secondary and temporary
          nature.
4. It is a physiological act.
    4. It is a psychological act.
5. It involves the reception of the message
    through ears.
       5. It involves the interpretation of the
          message received by ears.
6. It occurs at a subconscious level.
    6. It occurs at a conscious level.
7. It is a passive bodily process.
    8. It is an active mental process.
9. It is because we are neither aware nor
    we have any control over the sounds
    we hear.
       10. We listen to acquire knowledge and
          receive information.
11. Concentration is required.
    12. Concentration is not required.

```
In the words of Mark Twain, “Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening
when you would rather have talked.”
```
###### 5.3 Characteristics of listening

1. Listening is the ability to accurately receive and interpret messages in the communication
    process.
2. It’s how we make sense of, assess, and respond to what we hear.
3. Listening is a key to all effective communication.
4. Without the ability to listen effectively, communication erodes, a breakdown general
    ensues and the sender of the message can easily become frustrated or irritated.
5. Listening is a “soft skill” that is embedded into the most relevant qualifications employers
    look for in candidates.

###### 5.4 Plight of listening

The cacophony of modern life discourages listening. Noise levels in restaurants make diners strain
to hear one another. Offices are open design so every keyboard click, telephone call and post-lunch
belch makes for a constant racket. Traffic noise on city streets, piped music in shops and the bean
grinder at your local coffeehouse exceed the volume of normal conversation by as much as 30
decibels and can even cause hearing loss. All this when listening is arguably more valuable than
speaking. Wars have been fought, fortunes lost and friendships wrecked for lack of listening.

English Communication Skills


```
Unit 05: Listening Skills
```
```
The American president Calvin Coolidge said: “No man ever listened himself out of a job.”
It is by listening that we connect, comprehend, co-operate, empathize and develop as
human beings. It’s fundamental to any meaningful relationship – personal, professional or
political.
```
###### 5.5 Principles of listening

1. A good listener will listen not only to what is being said, but also to what is left unsaid or
    only partially said.
2. Effective listening therefore involves observing body language and noticing
    inconsistencies between verbal and non-verbal messages, as well as just what is being said
    at any given moment. For example, if someone tells you that they are happy with their life
    but through gritted teeth or with tears filling their eyes, you should consider that the
    verbal and non-verbal messages are in conflict. Maybe they don't mean what they say.
    Listening is therefore not just a matter of using your ears, but also your eyes.
3. Stop Talking: This implies that one must not always talk. One should listen as well. When
    somebody else is talking, listen to what they are saying, do not interrupt, talk over them or
    finish their sentences for them. Stop, just listen. When the other person has finished talking
    you may need to clarify to ensure you have received their message accurately.
4. Prepare Yourself to Listen and relax.
5. Focus on the speaker.
6. Put other things out of mind. The human mind is easily distracted by other thoughts –
    what’s for lunch, what time do I need to leave to catch my train, is it going to rain – try to
    put other thoughts out of mind and concentrate on the messages that are being
    communicated.
7. Put the Speaker at ease by helping the speaker to feel free to speak. Remember their needs
    and concerns. Nod or use other gestures or words to encourage them to
    continue. Maintain eye contact but don’t stare – show you are listening and understanding
    what is being said.
8. Remove Distractions and focus on what is being said. Don’t doodle, shuffle papers, look
    out the window, pick your fingernails or similar. Avoid unnecessary interruptions. These
    behaviors disrupt the listening process and send messages to the speaker that you are
    bored or distracted.
9. Empathize and try to understand the other person’s point of view. Look at issues from
    their perspective. Let go of preconceived ideas. By having an open mind, we can more
    fully empathize with the speaker. If the speaker says something that you disagree with,
    then wait and construct an argument to counter what is said but keep an open mind to the
    views and opinions of others.
10. Be Patient. A pause, even a long pause, does not necessarily mean that the speaker has
    finished. Be patient and let the speaker continue in their own time, sometimes it takes time
    to formulate what to say and how to say it. Never interrupt or finish a sentence for
    someone.
11. Avoid Personal Prejudice. Try to be impartial. Don't become irritated and don't let the
    person’s habits or mannerisms distract you from what the speaker is really saying.
    Everybody has a different way of speaking - some people are for example more nervous or
    shy than others, some have regional accents or make excessive arm movements, some
    people like to pace whilst talking - others like to sit still. Focus on what is being said and
    try to ignore styles of delivery.


12. Listen to the Tone. Volume and tone both add to what someone is saying. A good speaker
    will use both volume and tone to their advantage to keep an audience attentive;
    everybody will use pitch, tone and volume of voice in certain situations – let these help
    you to understand the emphasis of what is being said.
13. Listen for Ideas – Not Just Words. You need to get the whole picture, not just isolated bits
    and pieces. Maybe one of the most difficult aspects of listening is the ability to link
    together pieces of information to reveal the ideas of others. With proper concentration,
    letting go of distractions, and focus this becomes easier.
14. Wait and Watch for Non-Verbal Communication. Gestures, facial expressions, and eye-
    movements can all be important. We don’t just listen with our ears but also with our eyes
    - watch and pick up the additional information being transmitted via non-verbal
    communication.

```
In the words of Mark Twain, “If we were supposed to talk more than we listen, we
would have two tongues and one ear.”
```
###### 5.6 HURIER Model of listening

**H – Hearing**

‘Hearing’ is used here in a very broad sense. Not only does it refer to the physical act of hearing,
but also to picking up on non-verbal and other signals; tone of voice, body language and facial
expressions, for example.

**U – Understanding**

Once the message has been ‘heard’, the next step is to understand. This means tying together all the
elements of ‘hearing’ to create a coherent understanding of what was communicated. Factors like
language and accent may affect your understanding.

**R – Remembering**

Remembering requires focus. An effective listener needs to be able to remember the message they
are receiving in its entirety.

**I – Interpreting**

Interpretation of the message builds on, and enhances, understanding. Interpretation means
considering factors such as the context in which the message was sent. Importantly, here the
listener also needs to be aware of, and avoid, any preconceptions or biases that they may hold that
may affect how the message is interpreted.

**E – Evaluating**

Evaluating requires that the listener keeps an open mind on the messages they are receiving and
doesn’t jump to conclusions about what is being said. Evaluate all the information and only then
start to formulate a response.

**R – Responding**

Finally, your response should be well-measured and demonstrate that you have understood what
was communicated. It may be necessary to use techniques such as clarification and reflection as
part of the response.

**Highlights of HURIER Model of listening:**

1. The HURIER model can be a useful way to describe and remember the key components of
    effective or active listening.
2. It is important to understand, however, that the processes involved do not happen in a
    linear way.
3. An effective listener needs to be able to simultaneously hear, understand, interpret and
    evaluate the message to be able to formulate a clear understanding and an appropriate
    response.

###### 5.7 Active Listening

**How to become an Active listener?**

It takes a lot of concentration and determination to be an active listener. Old habits are hard to
break, and if your listening skills are as bad as many people's are, then you'll need to do a lot of
work to break these bad habits.

**_Pay Attention_**

Give the speaker your undivided attention, and acknowledge the message. Recognize that non-
verbal communication also "speaks" loudly. Look at the speaker directly. Put aside distracting
thoughts. Don't mentally prepare a rebuttal! Avoid being distracted by environmental factors. For
example, side conversations. "Listen" to the speaker's body language.

**_Show That You're Listening_**

Use your own body language and gestures to show that you are engaged. Nod occasionally. Smile
and use other facial expressions. Make sure that your posture is open and interested. Encourage the
speaker to continue with small verbal comments like yes, and "uh huh."

**_Provide Feedback_**

Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear. As a listener,
your role is to understand what is being said. This may require you to reflect on what is being said
and to ask questions. Reflect on what has been said by paraphrasing. "What I'm hearing is... ," and
"Sounds like you are saying... ," are great ways to reflect back.

**_Defer Judgment_**

Interrupting is a waste of time. It frustrates the speaker and limits full understanding of the
message. Allow the speaker to finish each point before asking questions. Don't interrupt with
counter arguments.


```
Respond Appropriately
```
```
Active listening is designed to encourage respect and understanding. You are gaining information
and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting her down. Be
candid, open and honest in your response. Assert your opinions respectfully. Treat the other person
in a way that you think they would want to be treated.
```
###### 5.8 Types of Listening

```
When we engage in listening, we are doing so for many different reasons depending upon the goals
in which we are trying to achieve. There are four different types of listening that are essential to
know when deciding what your goal as the listener is.
```
**Appreciative Listening**

```
When you listen for appreciation, you are listening for enjoyment. Think about the music you listen
to. You usually listen to music because you enjoy it. The same can be said for appreciative listening
when someone is speaking. Some common types of appreciative listening can be found in sermons
from places of worship, from a motivational speech by people we respect or hold in high regard, or
even from a standup comedian who makes us laugh.
```
**Empathetic Listening**

```
When you listen empathically you are doing so to show mutual concern. During this type of
listening, you are trying to identify with the speaker by understanding the situation in which
he/she is discussing. You are stepping into the other’s shoes to get a better understanding of what
it is he/she is talking about. Usually during this type of listening you want to be fully present in the
moment or mindfully listening to what the speaker is saying. Your goal during this time is to focus
on the speaker, not on yourself. You are trying to understand from the speaker’s perspective.
```
**Comprehensive Listening**

```
If you are watching the news, listening to a lecture, or getting directions from someone, you are
listening to understand or listening to comprehend the message that is being sent. This process is
active. In class, you should be focused, possibly taking notes of the speaker’s main ideas.
Identifying the structure of the speech and evaluating the supports he/she offers as evidence. This
is one of the more difficult types of listening because it requires you to not only concentrate but to
actively participate in the process. The more you practice listening to comprehend, the stronger
listener you become.
```
**Critical Listening**

```
Have you ever had to buy an expensive item, such as a new appliance, a car, a cell phone, or an
iPad? You probably did some research beforehand and listened closely to the salesperson when you
went to compare brands. Or perhaps your best friend is telling you about some medical tests
he/she recently had done. You listen closely so you can help your friend understand her results
and the possible ramifications of the findings. Both of these scenarios are examples of critical
listening. Critical listening is listening to evaluate the content of the message. As a critical listener
you are listening to all parts of the message, analyzing it, and evaluating what you heard. When
engaging in critical listening, you are also critically thinking. You are making mental judgments
based on what you see, hear, and read. Your goal as a critical listener is to evaluate the message that
is being sent and decide for yourself if the information is valid.
```
###### 5.9 How can one become a good listener?

```
It seems that we’re talking more than ever. And it’s true that we have more platforms for
connection and communication than ever before. But what feels like conversation is actually just
talking. Conversation – the exchange of ideas and thoughts between two people in which both
understand one another and respond to each other – is disappearing underneath the mountains of
tweets and posts, texts and emoticons.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 05: Listening Skills
```
1. The first barrier to listening is the phone that’s either in your hand or close enough for you
    to reach. Research shows it’s distracting, as part of your grey matter is occupied thinking
    about whether it will ping. So, the first step is not to put the phone down, but to put it
    away.
2. Next, stop avoiding conversations you think might lead to an argument and instead learn
    to have the discussion without arguing. You do that by choosing to learn from the
    conversation instead of teach. Don’t try to educate the other person, prove them wrong or
    change their mind, because that probably won’t happen.
3. In order to listen effectively, you have to allow thoughts to enter your head and then let
    them flow right back out so you can return to listening. That’s a discipline and an exercise
    in mindfulness. It’s not easy, but it’s necessary if you hope to really hear and understand
    what another person is saying.
4. We have all become very adept at expressing our own thoughts and feelings, and social
    media gives us endless methods for publishing them. But in all this talk, we aren’t
    listening.
5. Talking teaches you nothing, and so it’s no surprise when we learn nothing about each
    other and find it hard to empathize with those who disagree. We’ve stopped listening and
    therefore stopped learning.
6. While this all may feel like a homework assignment that you dread, learning to listen is an
    intensely rewarding experience. The people around you, even strangers, have secrets and
    hidden talents. If you haven’t heard them, you’ve missed out on a lot of fascinating stories
    and helpful advice.
7. So, put your mobile down and look at the people around you. Take a chance and ask
    someone a question, and then really listen to their answer. You might be surprised by the
    change in your perspective.

###### 5.10 Importance of Listening

**_Key to communication_**

Listening is an important part of any conversation. It helps to understand the view point of the
other party or the speaker in a better way. More than half of the conversation or communication is
paying attention to and understanding the other side.

**_Builds relationship_**

Communication is the basis of any relationship. Active and effective listening helps with
communicating and as a result, leads to better relationships and friendships.

**_Shows maturity and respect:_**

It shows maturity and respect to the speaker or the other parties involved in the conversation.
Constantly interrupting without listening never leads to a meaningful and enlightening
conversation.

**_Personal development:_**

Being a good listener leads to a more complete day-to-day life. A good listener always comes across
as a wise person, who can understand and empathize with others. The good listening skills lead to
more meaningful relations and less frustrating situations in our daily life.


```
Resolves issues:
```
```
Good listening skills help with resolving issues. Many of the problems can be solved by
understanding the viewpoints of everybody involved.
```
```
Career enhancement:
```
```
Being a good listener at work-place is very important. It helps establish positive working
relationships with bosses, clients, as well as colleagues at work. Good listening can help us establish
a good image and help separate us from average contributors.
```
###### Summary

```
Listening is the ability to accurately receive and interpret messages in the communication process.
It’s how we make sense of, assess, and respond to what we hear. Listening is a key to all effective
communication. Without the ability to listen effectively, communication erodes, a breakdown
general ensues, and the sender of the message can easily become frustrated or irritated. Listening is
a “soft skill” that is embedded into the most relevant qualifications employers look for in
candidates. Although listening is often confused with hearing, yet they both are actually quite
different from one another. While hearing is ability, listening is a skill that is acquired with
consistent practice. HURIER model of listening incorporates the elements of hearing,
understanding, remembering, interpreting, evaluating, and responding. Active listening involves
removing all distractions, listening to speaker’s signs and sounds and feeding back whatever one
has understood. There are different types of listening depending upon the aim and context behind
listening. Since the importance of listening can never be undermined, it is imperative to become
follow all the principles of listening.

After studying this unit, you will be able to:
```
```
 understand the meaning and importance of informational listening, critical and
empathetic listening
 discuss the differences between various types of listening
 become a good listener
 improve your listening behavior to enhance communication skills
```
###### Introduction

```
Different situations require different types of listening.
```
```
We may listen to:
```
```
 obtain information
 improve a relationship
 gain appreciation for something
 make discriminations
 engage in critical evaluation
```
```
While certain skills are basic and necessary for all types of listening (receiving, attending and
understanding), each type requires some special skills. Since each type of listening entails a
different skill set, it is imperative for us to understand the basic idea behind a particular kind of
listening.
```

Everything in writing begins with language. Language begins with listening.
```
###### 6.1 Informational listening

```
Informational listening is the name we give to a situation where the listener‘s primary concern is to
understand the message. Listeners are successful in so far as the meaning they assign to messages is
as close as possible to that which the sender intended. Informational listening, or listening to
```
Aneesha Pental, Lovely Prof essional University


```
understand, is found in all areas of our lives. Much of our learning comes from informative
listening. For example, we listen to lectures or instructions from teachers- and what we learn
depends on how well we listen. In the workplace, we listen to understand new practices and
procedures- and how well we perform depends on how well we listen. We listen to instructions,
briefings, reports and speeches; if we listen poorly, we aren‘t occupied with the information we
need.
```
**Variables of Informational Listening**

```
There are three key variables related to informative listening. Knowing these variables can help you
to begin to improve your informative listening skills; that is, you will increasingly become more
successful in understanding what the speaker means.
```
```
Vocabulary
```
```
The precise relationship between vocabulary and listening has never been determined, but it is
clear that increasing your vocabulary will increase your potential for better understanding. It‘s
never too late to improve your vocabulary.
```
```
How can you improve your vocabulary?
```
1. Have a genuine interest in words and language
2. Make a conscious effort to learn new words
3. Break down unfamiliar words into their component parts

```
Besides these, there are many other ways with the help of which one can improve their vocabulary
```
```
and augment the informational listening skills inadvertently:
```
1. Be sensitive to the context in which words are used.
2. Sometimes, unfamiliar words appear with synonyms. For example, ̳Her attractive
    winsome personality won us over‘.
3. At other times, a contrast is drawn. For example, ̳He is usually quite energetic, but today
    he seemed lethargic‘.
4. Occasionally, an unfamiliar word is used to summarize a situation or quality.
    For example, He passed for over 200 yards, ran for 50 more and his three punts averaged
    over 45 yards; he turned in a stellar performance.

```
Concentration
```
```
Concentration is cumbersome. You can remember times when another person was not
concentrating on what you were saying – and you probably can remember times when you were
not concentrating on something that someone was saying to you.
```
```
Following are the reasons behind why people don‘t concentrate while listening:
```
1. Sometimes, listeners try to divide their attention between two competing stimuli.
2. At other times, listeners are occupied with something other than the speaker of the
    moment.
3. Sometimes, listeners are too ego involved or too concerned with their needs to concentrate
    on the message being delivered. Or perhaps, they lack curiosity, interest or energy.
4. Many people have simply not learned to concentrate while listening.
5. Others just simply refuse to discipline themselves, lacking the motivation to accept
    responsibility for good listening.
6. Concentration requires discipline, motivation and acceptance of responsibility.

**Memory**

Memory is an especially crucial variable to informational learning. You cannot process information
without bringing memory into play. More specifically, memory helps your informational learning
in three ways:

1. It allows you to recall experiences and information necessary to function in the world
    around you. In other words, without memory, you would not have any knowledge bank.
2. It establishes expectations concerning what you will encounter. You would be unable to
    drive in heavy traffic, react to new situations or make common decisions in life without
    memory of your past experiences.
3. It allows you to understand what others say. Without simple memory of the meaning of
    the words, you could not communicate with anyone else. Without memory of concepts
    and ideas, you could not understand the meaning of messages.

```
How to become a better informational listener?
```
1. Paraphrase what was said
2. Watch for your own confirmation bias
3. Realize that what you believe is not necessarily accurate
4. Listen more for substance than style
5. Ask questions to yourself while listening to the speaker

**Barriers to Informational listening**

When listening to a person's message, it is common to overlook aspects of the conversation or make
judgments before all of the information is presented. This lack of effective listening is detrimental
to communication and is illustrated effectively by several specific obstacles. Chief among these
obstacles are confirmation bias and the vividness effect, both of which distort the speaker's message
by severely affecting the perception of a particular topic.

**Confirmation bias**

Confirmation bias is the tendency to pick out aspects of a conversation that support one's own
beliefs and values. This psychological process proves to have a detrimental effect on
communication for several reasons. First, confirmation bias tends to become involved in
conversation before the speaker finishes his/her message. As a result, an opinion is formed without
first obtaining all pertinent information. This, in turn, leads to uneducated thinking and fallacious
judgments that could later affect others. Second, confirmation bias detracts from a person's ability
to be open-minded.

For example, when listening to a statement, an individual may hear something at the beginning of
the conversation that arouses a specific emotion. Whether this is anger or frustration or anything
else, it could have a profound impact on that person's perception of the rest of the conversation. If
they were to become angry about a statement the speaker made early in the conversation, they
would likely be averse to accepting arguments presented later in the discourse.

To combat this bias and its consequences, an individual must be aware of it and its effects. With this
knowledge, an individual can learn to critically judge both sides of an argument before coming to a
conclusion.

**Vividness effect**

The vividness effect explains how vivid or highly graphic and dramatic events affect an
individual's perception of a situation. This phenomenon has been amplified by the media in recent
decades. With the use of media technology, graphic images can be used to portray an event. While
this makes the process of receiving news easier and more enjoyable, it can also blow a situation out
of proportion.


```
One year after the Columbine High School massacre, about 60 percent of the people who
responded to a survey by USA Weekend said that they felt a shooting was likely at their
own school. The reality was much different; in fact, the likelihood of a school shooting is
negligible across America.
```
```
The vividness effect was only amplified by the media. It existed long before the advent of television
or radio. When observing an event in person, an individual is automatically drawn toward the
sensational or vivid aspects. Thus, a person becomes quick to believe that all aspects of an event are
bad if they only remember the vivid parts that offended them.
```
```
To counter this, an individual must be aware of and deal with the inclination to the dramatic and
offensive, act accordingly. One must resist the temptation to jump to conclusions and instead weigh
all facts before judging.
```
```
Examples of Informational listening are as follows:
```
1. Watching news to acquire information and understand it
2. Listening to directions while learning to drive
3. Attending a lecture
4. Watching an instructional video
5. Attending a workshop
6. Listening to a news broadcast
7. Listening to an instructional podcast.

###### 6.2 Critical listening

```
Critical listening is listening to evaluate the content of the message. As a critical listener, you are
listening to all parts of the message, analyzing it, and evaluating what you heard. When engaging
in critical listening, you are also critically thinking. You are making mental judgments based on
what you see, hear, and read. Your goal as a critical listener is to evaluate the message that is being
sent and decide for yourself if the information is valid.
```
1. Have you ever had to buy an expensive item, such as a new appliance, a car, a cell
    phone, or a laptop? You probably did some research beforehand and listened
    closely to the salesperson when you went to compare brands.
2. Your best friend is telling you about some medical tests he/she recently had done.
    You listen closely so you can help your friend understand her results and the
    possible ramifications of the findings

```
Both of these scenarios are examples of critical listening.
```
```
Critical listening in this context means using careful, systematic thinking and reasoning to see
whether a message makes sense in light of factual evidence. It can be learned with practice but is
not necessarily easy to do. Some people never learn this skill; instead, they take every message at
face value even when those messages are in conflict with their knowledge. Critical listening in this

For example, a city treasurer giving a budget presentation might use very large words and
technical jargon, which make it difficult for listeners to understand the proposed budget
and ask probing questions.

**Improving Critical listening**

**_Recognize difference between Facts and Opinions_**

Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is credited with saying, ―Everyone is entitled to their own
opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts‖. Part of critical listening is learning to
separate opinions from facts, and this works two ways: critical listeners are aware of whether a
speaker is delivering a factual message, or a message based on opinion, and they are also aware of
the interplay between their own opinions and facts as they listen to messages. This is not to say that
speakers should not express their opinions. Many of the greatest speeches in history include
personal opinions. Consider, for example, Martin Luther King Jr.‘s famous ―I Have a Dream‖
speech, in which he expressed his personal wish for the future of American society. Critical
listeners may agree or disagree with a speaker‘s opinions, but the point is that they know when a
message they are hearing is based on opinion and when it is factual.

**_Uncovering Assumptions_**

If something is factual, supporting evidence exists. However, we still need to be careful about what
evidence does and does not mean. Assumptions are gaps in a logical sequence that listeners
passively fill with their own ideas and opinions and may or may not be accurate. When listening to
a public speech, you may find yourself being asked to assume something is a fact when in reality
many people question that fact. When listening to a public speech, you may find yourself being
asked to assume something is a fact when in reality many people question that fact.

```
For example, suppose you‘re listening to a speech on weight loss. The speaker talks about
how people who are overweight are simply not motivated or lack the self-discipline to lose
weight. The speaker has built the speech on the assumption that motivation and self-
discipline are the only reasons why people can‘t lose weight. You may think to yourself,
what about genetics?
```
By listening critically, you will be more likely to notice unwarranted assumptions in a speech,
which may prompt you to question the speaker if questions are taken or to do further research to
examine the validity of the speaker‘s assumptions. If, however, you sit passively by and let the
speaker‘s assumptions go unchallenged, you may find yourself persuaded by information that is
not factual. When you listen critically to a speech, you might hear information that appears
unsupported by evidence. You shouldn‘t accept that information unconditionally. You would
accept it under the condition that the speaker offers credible evidence that directly supports it.

**_Differences between Facts and Assumptions are as follows:_**

```
Facts Assumptions
```
1. Facts are verified by clear,
    unambiguous evidence.
       1. Assumptions are not supported by
          evidence.
2. Most facts can be tested.
    2. Assumptions about the future cannot
       be tested in the present.

**_Be open to new ideas_**

Sometimes people are so fully invested in their perceptions of the world that they are unable to
listen receptively to messages that make sense and would be of great benefit to them. Human
progress has been possible, sometimes against great odds, because of the mental curiosity and
discernment of a few people.

In the late 1700s when the technique of vaccination to prevent smallpox was introduced, it was
opposed by both medical professionals and everyday citizens who staged public protests (Edward
Jenner Museum). More than two centuries later, vaccinations against smallpox, diphtheria, polio,
and other infectious diseases have saved countless lives, yet popular opposition continues.


```
In the world of public speaking, we must be open to new ideas. Let‘s face it, people have a
tendency to filter out information they disagree with and to filter in information that supports what
they already believe.
```
```
Nicolaus Copernicus was a sixteenth-century astronomer who dared to publish a treatise
explaining that the earth revolves around the sun, which was a violation of Catholic
doctrine. Copernicus‘s astronomical findings were labeled heretical and his treatise banned
because a group of people at the time were not open to new ideas. In May of 2010, almost
five hundred years after his death, the Roman Catholic Church admitted its error and
reburied his remains with the full rites of Catholic burial (Owen, 2010).
```
```
While the Copernicus case is a fairly dramatic reversal, listeners should always be open to new
ideas. It is not suggested that you have to agree with every idea that you are faced with in life;
rather, at least listen to the message and then evaluate the message.
```
```
Rely on reason and common sense
```
```
If you are listening to a speech and your common sense tells you that the message is illogical, you
very well might be right. You should be thinking about whether the speech seems credible and
coherent. In this way, your use of common sense can act as a warning system for you. If you can
make effective comparisons while you are listening, it can deepen your understanding of the
message. If you can provide those comparisons for your listeners, you make it easier for them to
give consideration to your ideas.
```
```
Take Notes
```
```
Note-taking is a skill that improves with practice. You already know that it‘s nearly impossible to
write down everything a speaker says. In fact, in your attempt to record everything, you might fall
behind and wish you had divided your attention differently between writing and listening. Careful,
selective note-taking is important because we want an accurate record that reflects the meanings of
the message. However, much you might concentrate on the notes, you could inadvertently leave
out an important word, such as not, and undermine the reliability of your otherwise carefully
written notes. Instead, if you give the same care and attention to listening, you are less likely to
make that kind of a mistake.
```
```
It‘s important to find a balance between listening well and taking good notes. Many people struggle
with this balance for a long time. For example, if you try to write down only key phrases instead of
full sentences, you might find that you can‘t remember how two ideas were related. In that case,
too few notes were taken. At the opposite end, extensive note-taking can result in a loss of
emphasis on the most important ideas. To increase your critical listening skills, continue
developing your ability to identify the central issues in messages so that you can take accurate
notes that represent the meanings intended by the speaker.
```
```
Listen ethically
```
```
Ethical listening rests heavily on honest intentions. We should extend to speakers the same respect
we want to receive when it‘s our turn to speak. We should be facing the speaker with our eyes
open. We should not be checking our cell phones. We should avoid any behavior that belittles the
speaker or the message.
```
```
Examples of Critical listening are as follows:
```
```
Many people are keen on losing weight. So, they attend a seminar on weight loss. They
keep a focus on the statements made by the speaker. Furthermore, they also concentrate on
listening to understand weight gain. The speaker starts introducing products for weight
loss. But the participants might think that are these products reliable? Besides, if they are
critical listeners, then they might note unwanted assumptions. Especially made towards
the products and the line of treatment. Thus, this attitude urges to probe questions, helping
in clarifying doubts.
```

```
Several people are fond of attending a public speaking event. No matter what the event
might be, a listener always focuses on attempting to understand. Especially about the
motto behind the event. However, not everything stated in the speech might be true. But
how to confirm that? That‘s when a critical listener steps in to assess the message. He/she
analyzes the speech and figures out the context, to evaluate its authenticity.
```
###### 6.3 Empathetic Listening

Empathetic listening is a structured listening and questioning technique that allows you to develop
and enhance relationships with a stronger understanding of what is being conveyed, both
intellectually and emotionally. As such, it takes active listening techniques to a new level.

```
In the words of Stephen Covey, ―In emphatic listening you listen with your ears, but you
also, and more importantly, listen with your eyes and with your heart. You listen for
feeling, for meaning. You listen for behavior. You use right brain as well as your left. You
sense, you intuit, you feel.‘... ̳You have to open yourself up to be influenced.‘
```
If you know someone who is a good listener, they will likely have many friends. People like to be
around others that listen to them. In a world of change and pressure, it takes real effort to take time
to listen to others. Empathetic Listening is a method of listening that increasing your ability to
understand other people. This type of listening emphasizes the other person‘s point of view. It
provides a higher level of understanding of how others feel. Empathetic listening takes effort. It
also involves some risk. The risk comes from a chance of being hurt. Putting aside your own needs
to listen to another‘s and enter into another‘s thoughts and feelings requires a certain degree of
vulnerability. But this risk is worth it. You will never be able to see the world as others do until you
learn the skills needed for empathetic listening.

**Techniques for developing empathetic listening**

**_Develop good listening habits_**

To become an empathetic listener, you first must develop good listening habits. Listening is such a
common activity that we sometimes forget how important it is. For example, I‘m sure you can think
of a time when you thought you were listening, but as soon as the person finished talking to you
realized you had no idea what they said.

Start by mastering these simple good listening habits and you will be one step closer to becoming
an empathetic listener.

1. Let the person speak without interrupting or breaking in.
2. Don‘t say, ―I know how you feel.‖
3. Show your interest in what‘s being said.
4. Try to understand what the person is saying.
5. Try not to think about what you‘re going to say while the person is still talking.
6. Don‘t judge what the person is saying.
7. Keep an open mind.

**_Listen to understand_**

Most of us do not listen to understand, we listen only enough to reply with our own thoughts and
opinions. While the person is talking, we are thinking about what we are going to say next. This is
dangerous because it causes us to respond based on our own thoughts and feelings. When you
listen to understand, you pay attention to the thoughts and feelings of the person speaking.
Empathetic listening gives us the tools to see a problem, understand the effect it is having, and find
a solution. In order to help someone, we must first understand the problem from his or her point of
view. As Stephen Covey puts it, ―Seek first to understand, then to be understood.‖ When we set


```
aside our own thoughts and opinions, we begin to learn what others are thinking and feeling. Then,
and only then, can we begin to help someone in need.
```
```
Practice the four stages of empathetic listening
```
```
Alright, so we know that empathetic listening requires good listening habits and the ability to
understand other people. But what is empathetic listening, really? Empathetic listening can be
broken down into four stages, or steps.
```
```
Stage 1:
```
```
Copy what is being said. Simply repeat what you hear in order to get further understanding.
Repeat it exactly as you think you heard it.
```
```
Stage 2:
```
```
Say what you hear. Repeat the words that were said without adding anything new.
```
```
Stage 3:
```
```
Reflect on the feeling. Try to understand the feeling expressed in what was said, going beyond
what you think you heard.
```
```
Stage 4:
```
```
Restate what was said and think about the feeling. This combines stages 2 and 3 in order to
understand the message.
```
```
Avoid Misunderstandings
```
```
While empathetic listening takes time and work, it does not take nearly as much time and effort as
it does to correct a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding happens when a person fails to
understand correctly the meaning or intent of another person‘s words or actions. Or, more simply
put, the message meant to be sent is different from the message received. We‘ve all been involved
in misunderstandings. Maybe you thought you heard someone say one thing, but they actually
meant something else. The trouble with a misunderstanding is that you can‘t begin to correct it
until you realize that there has been a misunderstanding. Empathetic listening can help prevent or
keep misunderstandings from happening. The better you listen and the harder you work to
understand what others are thinking and feeling, the less likely you are to misunderstand them.
Luckily, listening is a learned skill. If you don‘t practice empathetic listening already, it‘s not too
late to start. Many people worry that they won‘t know what to say after they listen. Try not to
worry about that, just listen and let others talk.
```
```
Follow the rules of empathetic listening
```
```
One of the most important jobs of a friend is to be a good listener. Most people are more interested
in talking than they are in listening. Instead of really listening to what the other person is saying,
we just wait for your turn to speak.
```
```
To get you started, try following these rules of empathetic listening:
```
1. Pay attention to the feelings that others express—verbally and nonverbally. Try to
    understand
    the message behind the words and actions.
2. Don‘t put your own feelings in place of another‘s. Put aside your own needs and ideas
    long enough to listen to the other person‘s point of view.
3. Communicate in a more responsive way. Respond or give answers to the messages you
    receive to show you understand them.
4. Do not interrupt or break in. Let speakers finish what they are saying before you talk.
5. Ask questions for more information. If you still don‘t understand, ask questions until you
    do understand.

In the words of Carl Rogers, ―We think we listen, but rarely do we listen with real
understanding, true empathy, yet listening of this very special kind is one of the most
potent forces for change that I know.‖
```
```
Example of Empathetic listening is as follows:
```
```
As a manager, John prides himself on being there for his team members, and he
maintains an open-door policy. He feels that he knows each team member quite well
and regularly engages in "personal" conversations with them, staying up to date with
the events in their lives, both at work and outside of work.
```
```
A few more weeks go by and still not satisfied with her performance, John continues
to become more concerned for Natalie. Previously, she'd been the backbone of a
thriving team.
```
```
To get to root of the issue, John uses empathic listening techniques to discover the
source of Natalie's uncharacteristically poor work performance.
```
**Qualities of an empathetic listener**

**_Presence_**

More than just be physically in the same space with the speaker, presence entails being focused
closely on the conversation. To be present, it is important to minimize external distractions and
refrain from planning your responses while the other person is talking.

**_Compassion_**

The main component to being an empathic listener is identifying with the other person‘s emotional
experience. Even if you haven‘t experienced the same situation as the speaker, you can try to find
similarities anyway. For instance, if a coworker states that they are having trouble adjusting to an
increased workload, you may identify by thinking of a time when you had more chores at home.

**_Wisdom_**

If someone is sharing something emotionally important with you, it‘s likely because they trust your
judgment and experience. Wisdom includes both understanding the speaker‘s input and examining
the circumstances around the problem to better grasp all the factors involved. For example, if one of
your colleagues is having a conflict with another person in the department, you can acknowledge
one person‘s stress while also considering that the other party has their own challenges and is likely
not trying to be offensive.

**_Non-judgment_**

An important part of listening empathetically is to refrain from criticizing the other party, either out
loud or to yourself. You may find that you disagree with something the speaker has said, but
consider they have their own reasons for acting how they do.

###### Summary

Informational listening is the name we give to a situation where the listener‘s primary concern is to
understand the message. Listeners are successful in so far as the meaning they assign to messages is
as close as possible to that which the sender intended. Informational listening, or listening to
understand, is found in all areas of our lives. Much of our learning comes from informative
listening. Critical listening is the process a listener goes through using careful, systematic thinking
and reasoning to see whether a speaker‘s message makes sense in light of factual evidence. When
listeners are not critical of the messages they are attending to, they are more likely to be persuaded
by illogical arguments based on opinions and not facts. The role of an empathic listener is to be
supportive, kind and caring. Listen carefully and without judgment. Interject occasionally to show


```
that you've understood what's being said. Where appropriate, repeat key phrases to encourage the
speaker to open up. Pay attention to what's not being said, too. Take note of the speaker's emotional
state, their tone of voice, and their body language. And, when you successfully win their trust and
confidence, make sure that you respect it.

After studying this unit, you will be able to
```
- understand the meaning of dialect in language
- become cognizant of dialectal variations in English language
- find solutions to the problems faced while listening to varied dialects

###### Introduction

```
Listening entails the knowledge of different dialects in every language. Unless and until one is well
versed with myriad dialectal variations in a language, there will be umpteen numbers of problems
in interpreting and understanding the text that one comes across. Therefore, it is imperative to not
only know about varieties of dialects but also to understand the subtle differences between dialects
of the same language. As per the Cambridge dictionary, a dialect is a form of the language that is
spoken in a particular part of the country or by a particular group of people. There are many
different dialects of English, and they have different words and grammar. Most learners of English
learn the standard dialects of the language. There are many different forms of standard English: for
example, standard British English, standard American English, standard New Zealand English,
standard Indian English.
```
```
When foreign learners of English first come to the British Isles, they are usually surprised, and often
dismayed, to discover how little they understand of the English they hear. For one thing, people
seem to speak faster than expected. Also, the English that most British or Irish people speak seems
to be different in many ways from the English the visitor has learned. While it is probably
differences of pronunciation that will immediately strike them, learners may also notice differences
of grammar and vocabulary. Their reactions to this experience will vary. They may conclude that
most of the English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish people that they hear do not – or even cannot – speak
English correctly. In this they would find that many native speakers agree with them. They might
even be told that, since learners of English as a foreign or second language have usually studied
English in a formal way, they should know better than would native speakers what is ‘correct’.
```
```
Another reaction on the part of learners who fail to understand what is being said may be to think
that perhaps what they learned in their own country was not ‘real’ English. Fortunately, this is
increasingly unlikely to be the case. Although the English they have learned is real enough, it will
```

```
tend to be limited to a single variety of the language, a variety chosen to serve as a model for their
own speech. It will usually be the speech variety of a particular group of native speakers as that
variety is spoken, slowly and carefully, in relatively formal situations. Given limitations of time, of
teachers’ knowledge, and of students’ aspirations and attitudes, this restriction is entirely
reasonable, at least as far as speaking is concerned. Though learners may sound a little odd at
times, they will usually be able to make themselves understood. But such a restriction as far as
listening comprehension is concerned is less easily justified. While native speakers may be able to
decode the learners’ messages, they may lack the ability or the inclination to encode their own
messages in a form more comprehensible to learners. In many cases, of course, native speakers will
simply not be aware of such difficulties. Even when they are, a common strategy is to repeat what
has just been said, only louder, or to revert to ‘foreigner talk’ (‘me come, you go – OK?’), usually
making understanding even more difficult. It seems to us, then, that exposure to a number of
varieties of English, and help in understanding them, can play an important and practically useful
part in the study of English as a foreign language.
```
```
Even when learners with comprehension problems recognize that English, like their own language
```
- indeed, like every living natural language – is subject to variation, that variation can be so
complex and at times so subtle that it is usually a long time before they begin to see much order in
it. And native speakers, even those who teach the language, are often hard put to explain the things
that puzzle learners.

```
The standard dialects of the language are used by governments, in the media, in schools
and for international communication.
```
```
Examples of dialect forms in British English are:
```
1. I ain’t going to school today. (standard form: I’m not going to school today.)
2. She don’t understand. (standard form: She doesn’t understand.)
3. Would you like a cheese cob? (cob is a dialect word in parts of the north of England
    and means ‘bread roll’.)

```
Standard dialects are not better than other dialects, but we don’t use dialect words or
grammar in an essay, during an interview or in other formal contexts.
```
```
A dialect is not the same as an accent. An accent refers to the way we pronounce words
and the standard dialect of a language can be spoken with different accents.
```
```
A dialect is chiefly distinguished from other dialects of the same language by features of linguistic
structure—i.e., grammar (specifically morphology and syntax) and vocabulary.
```
```
In morphology (word formation), various dialects in the Atlantic states have clim, clum, clome,
or cloome instead of climbed, and, in syntax (sentence structure), there are “sick to his stomach,”
“sick at his stomach,” “sick in,” “sick on,” and “sick with.”
```
###### 7.1 Varieties of Dialect

```
On the level of vocabulary, examples of dialectal differences include American English subway,
contrasting with British English underground; and corn, which mean “maize” in the United States,
Canada, and Australia, “wheat” in England, and “oats” in Scotland. Nevertheless, while dialects of
the same language differ, they still possess a common core of features.
```
```
Geographic dialects
```
```
The most widespread type of dialectal differentiation is regional, or geographic. As a rule, the
speech of one locality differs at least slightly from that of any other place. Differences between
neighboring local dialects are usually small, but in traveling farther in the same direction,
differences accumulate. Geographic dialects include local ones (e.g., the Yankee English of Cape
Cod or of Boston, the Russian of Moscow or of Smolensk) or broader regional ones, such as
```

```
Unit 07: Listening Skills
```
Delaware Valley English, Australian English, or Tuscan Italian. Such entities are of unequal
rank; South Carolina English, for instance, is included in Southern American English. Regional
dialects do have some internal variation, but the differences within a regional dialect are
supposedly smaller than differences between two regional dialects of the same rank.

**Social dialects**

Another important axis of differentiation is that of social strata. In many localities, dialectal
differences are connected with social classes, educational levels, or both. More-highly educated
speakers and, often, those belonging to a higher social class tend to use more features belonging to
the standard language, whereas the original dialect of the region is better preserved in the speech of
the lower and less-educated classes.

Educational differences between speakers strongly affect the extent of their vocabulary. In addition,
practically every profession has its own expressions, which include the technical terminology and
sometimes also the casual words or idioms peculiar to the group.

**Slang**

Slang too is characterized mainly by a specific vocabulary and is much more flexible than an
ordinary dialect, as it is subject to fashion and depends strongly on the speaker’s age group.
Slang—just as a professional dialect—is used mainly by persons who are in a sense bidialectal; i.e.,
they speak some other dialect or the standard language, in addition to slang. Dialectal differences
also often run parallel with the religious or racial division of the population.

**Standard languages**

Standard languages arise when a certain dialect begins to be used in written form, normally
throughout a broader area than that of the dialect itself. The ways in which this language is used—
e.g., in administrative matters, literature, and economic life—lead to the minimization of linguistic
variation. The social prestige attached to the speech of the richest, most powerful, and most highly
educated members of a society transforms their language into a model for others.

In most developed countries, the majority of the population has an active (speaking, writing) or at
least passive (understanding) command of the standard language. Very often the rural population,
and not uncommonly the lower social strata of the urban population as well, are in reality
bidialectal. They speak their maternal dialect at home and with friends and acquaintances in casual
contacts, and they use the standard language in more formal situations. Even the educated urban
population in some regions uses the so-called colloquial language informally.

###### 7.2 Variations within Standard English

The Standard English dialect itself is subject to a certain amount of variation. Some of this is
regional: educated people in different parts of Britain do vary to a certain extent in the way in
which they speak, and even write, English. (These differences normally involve features which are
also found in the regional non-standard dialects.) And some of it is to do with age, all languages
and dialects change, and Standard English is no exception.

**1. Speakers of Standard English in the south of England tend to use contracted**
    **negatives of the type**

```
I haven’t got it She won’t go Doesn’t he like it? The further north one goes, the more likely one
is to hear the alternative type: I’ve not got it She’ll not go Does he not like it? This is
particularly true of Derbyshire, Lancashire, Cumbria and Scotland. In Scotland, forms of this
type are used particularly frequently. Elsewhere, it is more a matter of tendencies than of
absolute rules. Southern English speakers use the northern-type contraction in I’m not, since I
amn’t does not occur in Standard English, although it does in other dialects, such as those
spoken in Scotland. Southern English speakers also quite frequently use the you’re not ~ we’re
not ~ they’re not forms alongside the more typically southern-type forms with aren’t. Part of
the reason for this may lie in the stigmatised non-standard usage of this form with the first
person singular, I aren’t.
```

**2. In most grammatical descriptions of Standard English it is stated that the indirect**
    **object precedes the direct object**

```
She gave the man a book She gave him it She gave him the book If the preposition to is
employed, however, then of course the direct object can precede the indirect object: She gave a
book to the man She gave it to him She gave a book to him She gave it to the man In the south
of England, the forms with to seem to be the most common, particularly where the direct object
is a pronoun like him, her, it, them and so on. However, in the educated speech of people from
the north of England, other structures are also possible, as demonstrated in the following: (a)
She gave it him is very common indeed, and is also quite acceptable to many southern
speakers. (b) She gave it the man is also very common in the north of England, but is not found
in the south. (c) She gave the book him is not so common, but it can nonetheless be heard in the
north of England, particularly if there is contrastive stress on him. (d) She gave a book the man
is not especially common, but it does occur in northern varieties, particularly again if man is
contrastively stressed.
```
**3. There are regional differences in which participle forms are used after verbs such**
    **as need and want**

```
Southern England I want it washed
```
```
It needs washing
```
```
Parts of midland I want it washing
```
```
and northern England It needs washing
```
```
Scotland I want it washed
```
```
It needs washed
```
**4. There are a number of regional and age-group differences in the use of the verbs**
    **must and have to.**

```
These can be demonstrated with reference to Table given below. The forms in the negative
modal column have the meaning ‘he is not compelled to do it (but he can if he likes)’, while the
forms in the negative main verb column have the meaning ‘he is compelled not to do it’. The
epistemic uses (rows 2 and 4) are those where inferences are being drawn: ‘it is certain that he
is in (because I can hear his radio)’ and so on. It can be seen that in Standard English in the
south of England (the variety most often described in grammar books) only must appears in (c)
and only have to or have got to in (b). It will also be seen that 3(c) and 5(c) are blank, because
there is no way of saying ‘he must not do it’ in the past or future: one has to use constructions
such as ‘he wasn’t allowed to do it’ or ‘he won’t be allowed to do it’. In the north of England,
however, these gaps are filled. At 1(c), in these areas, it is possible to have he hasn’t to do it
(and, for some speakers, he’s not got to do it or he hasn’t got to do it – which are therefore
ambiguous in a way they are not in the south of England) with the additional meaning he
mustn’t do it. Similarly, with the past, 3(c), educated northern English can have he hadn’t to do
it, as well as he didn’t have to do it and he hadn’t got to do it or he’d not got to do it, which are
again ambiguous. And for the future, 5(c), northern speakers have he’ll not have to do it or he
won’t have to do it (which are ambiguous) and even he’ll haven’t to do it. At 2(c) and 4(c) the
usual northern forms are he mustn’t be in and he mustn’t have been in. And for many younger
speakers in both the north and the south, probably as the result of North American influence,
have to and have got to have also acquired epistemic use, particularly in positive, present tense
usage. Thus he must be the greatest player in the world can now also be he’s got to be the
greatest player in the world or he has to be the greatest player in the world.
```

```
Unit 07: Listening Skills
```
**5. It is possible to divide English verbs into two main classes according (among other**
    **criteria) to whether or not they employ auxiliary do in negatives and interrogatives**
    _He walked. He didn’t walk. Did he walk?_

```
He laughed. She didn’t laugh. Did she laugh?
```
```
She can leave. She can’t leave. Can she leave?
```
```
He will go. He won’t go. Will he go?
```
Verbs of the second type (without do) come into the category of modals and auxiliaries.

(a) The verbs ‘ought to’ and ‘used to’ are often described in English grammars as coming into this
second category, and indeed are employed in this way by some older speakers:

_He ought not to go. Ought he to go?_

_They used not to go. Used they to go?_

With younger speakers, however – and this is particularly true of the interrogative form, especially
with used to – these verbs are being reclassified in the first category:

_He didn’t ought to go. Did he ought to go?_

_They didn’t use to go. Did they use to go?_

In examining this variation, it is necessary to distinguish between stative meanings of the verb to
have and dynamic meanings. With stative meanings, we are dealing with some kind of stable
quality or state of affairs, where to have means something like ‘to be in possession of’. With
dynamic meanings, we are dealing with some kind of activity or temporary state of affairs, where
the verb means something like ‘to consume’, ‘to take’ and so on. Thus, I have some coffee in the
cupboard involves stative meaning, whereas I have coffee with my breakfast is dynamic. In English
English, until relatively recently, the verb to have required do-support – that is, it was treated like a
full verb – in the case of dynamic meanings only. Thus:

_Does she have coffee with her breakfast? No, she doesn’t._

_They didn’t have a good time last night._

With stative meanings, on the other hand, it was treated as an auxiliary and did not require do-
support. Thus:

_Have they any money? No, they haven’t_

_They hadn’t any coffee in the cupboard_

In American English, on the other hand, do-support is required in both cases, so the verb to have is
treated as a main verb regardless of whether it has dynamic or stative meanings. Thus:

_Does she have coffee with her breakfast? No, she doesn’t._


```
They didn’t have a good time last night.
```
```
Do they have any money? No, they don’t.
```
```
They didn’t have any coffee in the cupboard.
```
```
In Scottish English and to a certain extent in the north of England as well as in many parts of
Ireland, we find the opposite situation – there is no distinction between dynamic and stative
meanings, the verb to have being treated as an auxiliary in all cases. Thus, in addition to saying:
Have they any money? No, they haven’t
```
```
They hadn’t any coffee in the cupboard
```
```
In Scottish English one can say:
```
```
Has she coffee with her breakfast? No, she hasn’t.
```
```
They hadn’t a good time last night.
```
```
Though this is probably used more rarely by younger Scottish people than it is by people of their
grandparents’ generation. This difference in the status of have is also demonstrated by different
possibilities of phonological contraction (only auxiliary have can be contracted). Thus:
```
```
US English I have no money. I had a good time.
```
```
English English I’ve no money. I had a good time.
```
```
Scottish English I’ve no money. I’d a good time.
```
```
In both American and British English, it is also very usual with stative meanings in more informal
styles to use the have got construction, for example:
Have they got any money? No, they haven’t.
```
```
They hadn’t got any coffee in the cupboard.
```
```
There is also the further complication that the American-style lack of grammatical distinction
between stative and dynamic meanings has had an influence on the English of England,
particularly among younger southern speakers. This means that in southern England English we
now have the possibility, with stative meanings, of using three different types of construction:
```
```
Have you got any money? (informal)
```
```
Have you any money? (formal, older)
```
```
Do you have any money? (newer)
```
```
It is well known that certain verb-particle constructions in English have alternative forms as
follows:
```
```
(a) He turned out the light. Put on your coat! She took off her shoes.
```
```
(b) He turned the light out. Put your coat on! She took her shoes off.
```
```
There is, however, regional variation with respect to this usage in Britain. All speakers will accept
both (a) and (b) as normal English, but speakers in the south of England are more likely to employ
the (b) forms in their own speech, whereas Scottish speakers very frequently use forms of type (a).
```
**6. Like**

```
Like is becoming increasingly frequent in the speech of younger British and Irish people,
regardless of whether they speak standard or non-standard dialects. Like fulfils several
functions: it can function as a pause filler, as in Are you, like, coming to the cinema tonight? as well
as an intensifier, serving to draw attention to a following piece of information :
```
```
It was like the funniest film I’ve ever seen.
```
```
It can also function, with the verb be, as a means of directly reporting speech (equivalent to
said, etc.) or a person’s (unverbalised) emotional status, as in:
```
```
They were like, ‘I hate this place’ but she’s like, just shut up both of you.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 07: Listening Skills
This last function of like is termed quotative (be) like (see Tagliamonte and Hudson 1999;
Dailey-O’Cain 2000; Buchstaller and D’Arcy 2009), and it is thought to have been imported
fairly recently into British English from North America. Note that several of the speakers on
the website recordings use like frequently for all three functions, and they are not necessarily
the younger ones (e.g. the London and Aberdeen speaker). The quotative system in
contemporary English is highly complex, and new forms are being adopted with amazing
rapidity. Cheshire et al. (2011) give an account of a new quotative this is + speaker in the
speech of young Londoners, for example:
```
```
This is them ‘What area are you from, what part?’
```
```
This is me ‘I’m from Hackney.
```
###### 7.3 Traditional dialects

Traditional dialects are those conservative dialects of English which are, for the most part, spoken
in relatively isolated rural areas by certain older speakers and which differ considerably from
Standard English, and indeed from one another. Traditional dialects are what most British people
think of when they hear the term ‘dialect’ used in a non-technical way. They correspond to those
varieties which are known as ‘patois’ in the French speaking world and ‘Mundart’ in German-
speaking areas.

a) Grammatical features which are typical of certain traditional dialects include the following: (a)

```
In most Scottish dialects, negation is not formed with not, but with no or with its more
typically Scottish forms nae /ne/ or na /na/. Thus we find forms in Scottish English such as:
```
```
He’s no coming. I’ve nae got it.
```
```
I cannae go. We do na have one.
```
b) In large areas of the north of England, including urban areas of Yorkshire, as well as in many

```
areas of the rural south-west of England, the older distinction still survives (though it is now
rare) between the informal singular second person pronouns thou, thee, thine and formal
and/or plural you ~ yours. In the north of England, the usual subject and object form of this
pronoun is tha, while in the south-west it tends to be thee. The system operates very much as
in modern French, with friends and family being referred to as tha and people who one does
not know so well being called you. It is also sometimes the case that distinct verb forms
associated with second person singular still survive; for example, tha cast ‘you can’.
```
c) In large areas of the south-west of England, including Devon and Somerset, a system of

```
personal pronouns exists in which the form of the pronoun is not, for the most part,
determined by subject versus object function, but by weak or strong stress position. For
example:
```
```
strong weak
```
```
you ee
```
```
he er (subject), ’n (object)
```
```
she er
```
```
we us
```
```
they ’m
```
Thus: _You wouldn’t do that, would ee?_

_He wouldn’t do that, would er?_

_No, give ’n to he._


```
She wouldn’t do that, would er?
```
```
No, give ’n to she.
```
```
We wouldn’t do that, would us?
```
```
No, give ’n to we.
```
```
They wouldn’t do that, would ’m?
```
```
No, give ’m to they.
```
```
d) In many traditional dialects of the south-west of England, the gender system operates in a
manner unlike that existing in Standard English, in that mass nouns such as water and bread
are usually referred to as it, while count nouns such as hammer and tree are referred to as he,
er or ’n. Thus one would say:
```
```
Pass me the bread. It’s on the table
```
```
but
```
```
Pass me the loaf. He’s on the table.
```
###### 7.4 Problems in listening to unfamiliar dialects

```
Despite our growing awareness of variation and its role in second-language acquisition, and the
recent attention given to variability in the learner’s inter-language (see Ellis, 1986), much current
research and pedagogy presumes a single dialect of the target language as a baseline for the
analysis of the learner’s comprehension and production.
```
```
The limitations imposed by such an assumption are particularly inappropriate for the consideration
of second-language acquisition in urban centers, which are likely to contain speakers representing a
range of social and regional dialects. Hyltenstam (1981) and Kachru (1982) have emphasized the
fact that many learners must communicate in an environment that involves contact with speakers
of diverse target-language varieties. In the process of second language acquisition or learning a
foreign language like English, listening to this language is imperative to improve the reading,
writing and speaking skills. However, a listener might face a set of problems that inhibit the process
of listening comprehension. Since every speaker has a different style, pronunciation and dialect of
speaking in English, the listener must be made cognizant of the dialectal variations along with
other disparities.
```
```
To make words serviceable to the end of communication, it is necessary that they excite in the
Hearer, exactly the same idea they stand for in the mind of the speaker. Without this, men fill one
another’ hands with noise and sounds; but convey not their thoughts and lay not before one
another, their ideas which is the end of Discourse and language.
```
```
John Locke’s conception of the nature of verbal communication and listening comprehension may
seem both perceptive and contemporary to today’s second language acquisition researchers and
teachers, but such a view of human understanding was neither original to Locke nor novel to his
time. A number of countries are English-speaking: England, America, Australia...even Ireland and
a few others have native English speakers. Inside each of these countries there are even more
dialects. Someone from New York sounds very different from someone from Texas.
```
```
The following are the problems you might face as listener:
```
1. Unfamiliar dialect
2. Different spellings in different dialects
3. Variation in Pronunciation of words
4. Inability to understand the context in case of a different social dialect

```
According to Azmi Bingol, Celik, Yidliz, and Tugrul Mart (2014), there are a lot of difficulties that
learners may encounter in the listening comprehension processes and the purpose is to be aware of
these problems and try to solve them. Some of these problems are as follows:
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 07: Listening Skills
```
**_Quality of Recorded Materials_**

In some classes, teachers use some recorded materials that do not have high quality. The quality of
sound system can impact the comprehending of learners’ listening.

**_Cultural Differences_**

Learners should be familiar with the cultural knowledge of language that has a significant effect on
the learners’ understanding. If the listening task involves completely different cultural materials,
then the learners may have critical problems in their comprehension. It is the responsibility of
teachers to give background knowledge about the listening activities in advance.

**_Accent_**

Munro and Derwing (1999) expressed that too many accented speech can lead to an important
reduction in comprehension. According to Goh (1999), 66% of learners mentioned a speaker’s
accent as one of the most significant factors that affect listener comprehension. Unfamiliar accents
both native and non-native can cause serious problems in listening comprehension and familiarity
with an accent helps learners’ listening comprehension. Buck (2001) indicated that when listeners
hear an unfamiliar accent such as Indian English for the first time after studying only American
English will encounter critical difficulties in listening. This will certainly interrupt the whole
listening comprehension process and at the same time an unfamiliar accent makes comprehension
impossible for the listeners.

**_Unfamiliar Vocabulary_**

According to Azmi Bingol, Celik, Yidliz, and Tugrul Mart (2014), when listening texts contain
known words it would be very easy for students to them. If students know the meaning of words
this can arouse their interest and motivation and can have a positive impact on the students’
listening comprehension ability. A lot of words have more than one meaning and if they are not
used appropriately in their appropriate contexts students will get confused.

**_Length and Speed of Listening_**

Azmi Bingol, Celik, Yidliz, and Tugrul Mart (2014) stated that the level of students can have a
significant role when they listen to long parts and keep all information in their mind. It is very
difficult for lower-level students to listen more than three minutes long and complete the listening
tasks. Short listening passages make easy listening comprehension for learners and reduce their
tiredness. According to Underwood (1989), speed can make listening passage difficult. If the
speakers speak too fast students may have serious problems to understand L2 words. In this
situation, listeners are not able to control the speed of speakers, and this can create critical problems
with listening comprehension.

###### 7.5 Solutions to the problems associated with dialect

1. Attain background knowledge and linguistic knowledge, such as complex sentence structures

```
and colloquial words and expressions, as needed.
```
2. Try to get, as much feedback as possible. Throughout the course, the teacher should bridge the

```
gap between input and students’ response and between the teacher’s feedback and students’
reaction in order to keep activities purposeful.
```
3. It is important for the listening-class teacher to give students immediate feedback on their

```
performance. This not only promotes error correction but also provides encouragement. It can
help students develop confidence in their ability to deal with listening problems. Student
feedback can help the teacher judge where the class is going and how it should be guided.
```
4. Students should develop the skills of listening with anticipation, listening for specific

```
information, listening for gist, interpretation and inference, listening for intended meaning,
listening for attitude, etc., by providing varied tasks and exercises at different levels with
different focuses.
```

###### Summary

```
English language is a complex language as it is a blend of myriad dialects and accents. Owed to the
diversity of dialects and other variations in terms of pronunciation, vocabulary and accent, learners
can face a lot of issues in the understanding after listening to unfamiliar dialects in English.
A dialect is chiefly distinguished from other dialects of the same language by features of linguistic
structure—i.e., grammar (specifically morphology and syntax) and vocabulary. The most
widespread type of dialectal differentiation is regional, or geographic. In many localities, dialectal
differences are connected with social classes, educational levels, or both. Slang—just as a
professional dialect—is used mainly by persons who are in a sense bidialectal; i.e., they speak some
other dialect or the standard language, in addition to slang. Standard languages arise when a
certain dialect begins to be used in written form, normally throughout a broader area than that of
the dialect itself. Traditional dialects are those conservative dialects of English which are, for the
most part, spoken in relatively isolated rural areas by certain older speakers and which differ
considerably from Standard English, and indeed from one another.

###### Introduction

Language is an organization of sounds, of vocal symbols-the sounds produced from the mouth
with the help of various organs of speech to convey some meaningful message. Language has a
very important social purpose, because it is mainly used for linguistic communication. It is the most
powerful, convenient and permanent means and form of communication. A language can be used
in two ways for the purposes of communication. It can be spoken or written but the medium of
speech is more important than writing. This is because speech comes first in the history of any
language community – in fact, it came centuries before writing in the history of any language
community. Secondly, speech comes first in the history of any individual. We started speaking long
before we started writing. Speech as a medium of communication is used much more than the
medium of writing. In every language, a letter of the alphabet represents a particular sound. Lastly,
modern technology has contributed tremendously to the importance of speech- modern inventions
like the telephone, the radio, the tape recorder and several such devices have raised problems of
communication primarily concerned with speech.

Pronunciation means how we say words. Most people speak the dialect of Standard English with
an accent that belongs to the part of the country they come from or live in. Learners of British
English commonly hear RP (Received Pronunciation), which is an accent often used on the BBC and
other news media and in some course materials for language learners, but it is also common to hear
a variety of regional accents of English from across the world. According to the Cambridge English
dictionary, pronunciation is the way in which a word or letter is said, or said correctly, or the way
in which a language is spoken. How we use spoken stress and rhythm is also an important part of
pronunciation. For example, it is important to know which syllables in a word are stressed and how
different patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables are pronounced. There are also common
patterns of intonation in English which enable us to give special emphasis to particular words,
phrases and sentences.
```
```
Syllable
```
```
A syllable is a single unit of speech, either a whole word or one of the parts into which a word can
be separated, usually containing a vowel.
```
###### 8.1 Aspects of Pronunciation

```
Aspects of pronunciation refer to all those elements of English pronunciation that carve the stencil
for correct English pronunciation. Each aspect is interlinked to the other aspect and knowledge of
every element is a pre requisite to hone the skill of correct English pronunciation.
```
```
The aspects of English pronunciation are as follows:
```
1. Vowels
2. Consonants
3. Voicing
4. Aspiration
5. Assimilation
6. Elision
7. Word Stress
8. Sentence Stress
9. Intonation

###### 8.2 Vowels

```
A vowel is a speech sound produced by humans when the breath flows out through
the mouth without being blocked by the teeth, tongue, or lips. A vowel is also
a letter that represents a sound produced in this way:
```
```
The vowels in English are: a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y.
```
1. The word Iouea (a genus of sea sponges) contains all five vowels and no other
    letters. (Being the name of a genus (i.e., a proper noun), it is written with a capital
    letter. Also of note, it is the shortest word with four syllables.)
2. The words abstemious and facetious contain all five vowels in order.

**Classification of Vowels**

```
The most generally used description of vowel sounds is based on a combination of articulatory and
auditory criteria, and takes into account the following physical variables:
```
1. Tongue shape
2. Lip shape

English Communication Skills


```
Unit 08: Speaking Skills
```
3. Whether tongue and/or lip shape are held constant or undergo change (i.e., is the vowel a

```
steady-state vowel or is it a diphthong?)
```
4. Position of the soft palate (nasal or non-nasal) Finally, we have a non-physical variable which

```
operates in a large number of languages
```
5. Duration

```
Change in the shape of the tongue is perhaps the most important of all these factors.
```
1. Say the English vowel /a:/, as in palm. Put your finger in your mouth. Now say the
    vowel /i:/ (as in fleece). Feel inside your mouth again. Look in a mirror and see how
    the front of the tongue lowers from being close to the roof of the mouth for /i:/ to
    being far away for /a:/. Now you know why doctors ask you to say ‘ah’ when they
    want to see inside your mouth; the tongue is at its lowest when you say /a:/
2. Now say these English vowels: /i:/, as in fleece, /Ɛ:/, as in square, /æ/, as in trap.
    Can you feel the tongue moving down?
3. Then say them in reverse order: /æ/, /Ɛ:/, /i:/.
    Can you feel the tongue moving up?

```
As the tongue lowers, the oral cavity opens and increases in size. Consequently, the oral
cavity is bigger for /ai/ than it is for /ii/, and as a result it produces a lower pitched
resonance.
```
Vowels traditionally have been specified in terms of the position of the highest point of the tongue
and the position of the lips.

**_Front Vowels_**

The highest point of the tongue is in the front of the mouth for the vowels in ‘heed’, ‘hid’, ‘head’,
and ‘had’. Accordingly, these vowels are classified as front vowels.

**_Back Vowels_**

The vowels in ‘hod’, ‘hawed’, ‘hood’, and ‘who’d’ are classified as back vowels.

```
Close Vowels: The tongue is highest in the vowels in ‘heed’ and ‘who’d’, which are
therefore called high, or close, vowels.
```
```
Open Vowels: The tongue is lowest in the vowels in ‘had’ and ‘hod’, which are called
low, or open, vowels.
```
```
Mid Vowels : The height of the tongue for the vowels in the other words is between these
two extremes, and they are therefore called mid vowels.
```
Lip positions may be described as being _rounded_ , as in ‘who’d’, or _unrounded_ or _spread_ , as in ‘heed’.
Because of the difficulty of observing the precise tongue positions that occur in vowels, a set of
eight vowels known as the cardinal vowels has been devised to act as reference points. This set of
vowels is defined partly in articulatory and partly in auditory terms.

Lip shape Change of lip shape is also a significant factor in producing different vowel qualities. The
main effects of lip-rounding are:

1. to enlarge the space within the mouth;


2. to diminish the size of the opening of the mouth.

```
Both of these factors deepen the pitch and increase the resonance of the front oral cavity. The lip
shapes of the primary CVs follow the pattern typically found in languages worldwide. Front and
open vowels have spread to neutral lip position, whilst back vowels have rounded lips. (The UPSID
survey of world languages, carried out by the University of California, has shown that over 90 per
cent of front and back vowels are unrounded and rounded respectively.
```
```
Cardinal Vowels
```
```
It was not until early in the twentieth century that a reasonably accurate system of describing and
classifying vowels was devised. In 1917, the British phonetician Daniel Jones (1881–1967) produced
his system of cardinal vowels (often abbreviated to CVs), a model which is still widely employed to
this day. For any vowel, the tongue must be arched into a hump (termed the tongue arch).
```
```
We can always distinguish the highest point of the tongue arch for any vowel articulation. There is
an upper vowel limit beyond which the surface of the tongue cannot rise in relation to the roof of
the mouth – otherwise friction will be produced. The vowels at the upper vowel limit are the front
vowel and the back vowel.
```
```
There is also a lower vowel limit beyond which the tongue cannot be depressed. This gives us two
other extreme vowels – a front vowel [a] and a back vowel [a].
```
```
Phoneticians who have been trained in the cardinal vowel system are able to make precise
descriptions of the vowels of any language in terms of these reference points.
```
```
Monophthongs
```
```
A monophthong is where there is one vowel sound in a syllable, and a diphthong is where there are
two vowel sounds in a syllable. Say the word ‘funny’ out-loud. As you can hear, in ‘funny’ we have
two vowel sounds: ʌ and i which are divided into two syllables by the consonant sound n. So, we
can say that ‘funny’ contains two monophthongs: ʌ and i.
```
```
Diphthongs
```
```
To put it simply,a monophthong is a single vowel, and a diphthong is a double vowel. Say the
word ‘guy’. Here, we have the same two vowel sounds but this time they are stuck together in one
syllable, without any consonant dividing them. So we can say that ‘guy’ contains one diphthong
/ ai/.
```
```
There are 8 IPA symbols for English Diphthong vowels. The IPA for English Diphthong vowels
are: /eɪ/, /oʊ/, /aʊ/, /ɪə/, /eə/, /ɔɪ/, /aɪ/, /ʊə/.
```
```
/eɪ/ - place /pleɪs/ late/leɪt/ dangerous/ˈdeɪn.dʒə.rəs/
```
```
/oʊ/ - home /hoʊm/ phone /foʊn/ global /ˈɡloʊ.bəl/
```

/aʊ/ - mouse /maʊs/ brown /braʊn/ accountant /əˈkaʊn.t̬ənt/

/aɪ/ - find /faɪnd/ bite /baɪt/ tiger /ˈtaɪ.ɡə/
/ʊə/ - tour /tʊə/ pure /pʊə/ mature /məˈtʃʊə/
```
The following system can be used for vowel description. The areas of the vowel diagram are
designated in the way shown in the following diagram:

**International Phonetic Alphabet**

Learners of foreign languages use the IPA to check exactly how words are pronounced. Each IPA
symbol represents a sound. For example, a learner of English can use the IPA to find out exactly
what sounds are in a word and where the word stress is. It is an extremely helpful tool for people
learning to speak another language. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is very important
for learners of English because English is not a phonetic language. The spelling of an English word
doesn’t tell us how to pronounce it. In English, several different letter combinations can be used to
spell the same sound and there are silent letters. The IPA tells us the correct sounds and word stress
for pronouncing English words.

**_Short Vowels_**

A short English vowel is noticeably shorter than a long vowel. An English short vowel is made with
only one mouth position. One mouth position is represented by one IPA symbol (every sound
/mouth position has a different IPA symbol). The weak vowel schwa is the most common vowel in
English.

There are 7 IPA symbols for English short vowels. The IPA for English short vowels are: /ɪ/, /e/,
/æ/, /ʌ/, /ʊ/, /ɒ/, /ə/

```
/ɪ/ fit /fiːt/ pick /piːk/ difficult/ˈdɪ.fɪ.kəlt/
/e/ pet/pet/ sent/sent/ attention/əˈten.ʃən/
/æ/ pat/pæt/ flat /flæt/ family/ˈfæ.mə.li/
/ʌ/ cut /kʌt/ jump /dʒʌmp/ cover /ˈkʌ.vər/
/ʊ/ put/pʊt/ book/bʊk/ cushion /ˈkʊ.ʃən/
/ɒ/ pot/pɒt/ dog/dɒg/ hospital/ˈhɒs.pɪ.təl/
/ə/ about /əˈbaʊt/ system /ˈsɪs.təm/ complete /kəmˈpliːt/
```
**_Long Vowels_**

English long vowels have two dots like this – /:/ after the vowel symbol. If it has /:/ after it, you
know it’s a long vowel. English long vowels are noticeably longer than short vowels.
Distinguishing between short and long vowels is very important in English because they mean


different words. There are 5 IPA symbols for English long vowels. The IPA for English long vowels
are: /i:/, /ɑ:/, /ɔ:/, /ɜ:/, /u:/.

For example, ‘ship and sheep’, ‘wick and week’.

An English long vowel is only one symbol in the IPA because it is one mouth position.

```
/i:/ week/wi:k/ feet/fi:t/ media/ˈmiː.di.jə/
/ɑ:/ hard/ha:/ park/pa:k/ article/ɑː.tɪ.kəl/
/ɔ:/ fork/fɔ:k/, walk/wɔ:k/, August/ɔːˈɡʌst/
/ɜ:/ heard/hɜ:d/ word /wɜ:d/ surface/ˈsɜː.fɪs/
/u:/ boot /bu:t/ group /gru:p/ beautiful /ˈbjuː.tɪ.fəl/
```
###### 8.3 Consonants

Consonant is any speech sound, such as that represented by _t, g, f,_ or _z,_ that is characterized by
an articulation with a closure or narrowing of the vocal tract such that a complete or partial
blockage of the flow of air is produced.

**Classification of consonants**

Consonants are usually classified according to:

1. place of articulation (the location of the stricture made in the vocal tract, such as dental,

```
bilabial, or velar)
```
2. the manner of articulation (the way in which the obstruction of the airflow is accomplished, as

```
in stops, fricatives, approximants, trills, taps, and laterals)
```
3. the presence or absence of voicing
4. nasalization, aspiration, or other phonation

**_Place of articulation_**

It tells us where the sound is produced. If we classify them according to the organs which articulate
them, we distinguish six main classes.

**_Labial or lip sounds, which may be sub-divided into:_**

Bi-labial sounds, viz. sounds articulated by the two lips: examples p, m, v.

Labio-dental sounds, viz. sounds articulated by the lower lip against the upper teeth: example f.

English Communication Skills


```
Unit 08: Speaking Skills
```
**_Dented sounds_**

Sounds articulated by the tip or blade of the tongue against the upper teeth or teeth-ridge. It is often
convenient to sub divide these into two classes.

1. Pre-dental sounds, viz. sounds articulated by the tip or blade of the tongue against the teeth:

```
example Ѳ, French t.
```
2. Post-dental, or alveolar, sounds, viz. sounds articulated by the tip or blade of the tongue

```
against the teeth-ridge: examples z, ʃ, and the English t.
```
**_Palatal sounds_**

These sounds are articulated by the front of the tongue against the hard palate: example j.

**_Velar sounds_**

These sounds are articulated by the back of the tongue against the soft palate: examples k, η.


```
Uvular sounds
```
```
These sounds are articulated by the back of the tongue and the extremity of the soft palate or the
uvula: example R.
```
```
Glottal sounds
```
```
These sounds are articulated in the glottis.
```
```
Alveolar sounds
```
```
In an alveolar consonant, the tongue tip (or less often the tongue blade) approaches or touches the
alveolar ridge, the ridge immediately behind the upper teeth. The English stops [t], [d], and [n] are
formed by completely blocking the airflow at this place of articulation. The fricatives [s] and [z] are
also at this place of articulation, as is the lateral approximant [l].
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 08: Speaking Skills
```
**Post alveolar**

In a post alveolar consonant, the constriction is made immediately behind the alveolar ridge. The
constriction can be made with either the tip or the blade of the tongue. The English
fricatives [ʃ] and [ʒ] are made at this POA, as are the corresponding affricates [tʃ] and [dʒ].

**_Retroflex_**

In a retroflex consonant, the tongue tip is curled backward in the mouth. English [ɹ] is a retroflex
approximant -- the tongue tip is curled up toward the postal veolar region (the area immediately
behind the alveolar ridge) Both the sounds we've called "postal veolar" and the sounds we've called
"retroflex" involve the region behind the alveolar ridge. In fact, at least for English, you can think of
retro flexes as being a sub-type of post alveolar, specifically, the type of post alveolar that you make
by curling your tongue tip backward. In fact, the retro flexes and other post alveolar sound so
similar that you can usually use either one in English without any noticeable effect on your accent.
A substantial minority North American English speakers don't use a retroflex [ɹ], but rather a
"bunched" R -- sort of like a tongue-blade [ʒ] with an even wider opening. Similarly, a few people
use a curled-up tongue tip rather than their tongue blades in making [ʃ] and [ʒ].)

**_Manner of articulation_**

In articulatory phonetics, the manner of articulation is the configuration and interaction of the
articulators (speech organs such as the tongue, lips, and palate) when making a speech sound.
Homorganic consonants, which have the same place of articulation, may have different manners of
articulation.

If we classify consonants according to the manner in which the organs articulate them, we
distinguish six main classes.

**_Plosive consonants_**

They are formed by completely closing the air passage and suddenly removing the obstacle. so that
the air escapes making an explosive sound: examples ‘p’, ‘d’, ‘g’ These sounds are called stops by
many writers. In the stop [t], the tongue tip touches the alveolar ridge and cuts off the airflow.
In [s], the tongue tip approaches the alveolar ridge but doesn't quite touch it. There is still enough
of an opening for airflow to continue, but the opening is narrow enough that it causes the escaping
air to become turbulent (hence the hissing sound of the [s]).

**_Fricative consonant_**

In a fricative consonant, the articulators involved in the constriction approach get close enough to
each other to create a turbulent airstream. The fricatives of English are [f], [v], [θ], [ð], [s], [z], [ʃ],
and [ʒ].


**_Nasal consonants_**

They are formed by completely closing the mouth at some point, the soft palate remaining lowered
so that the air is free to pass out through the nose: examples m, n. (The nasal consonants are the
only English sounds in which the soft palate is lowered.)

**_Lateral consonants_**

They are formed by an obstacle placed in the middle of the mouth, the air being free to escape at the
sides. These sounds are sometimes called divided consonants of side consonants.

**_Rolled consonants_**

They are formed by a rapid succession of taps of some elastic organ: example rolled r. These sounds
are often called trilled consonants. V. Fricative consonants, formed by narrowing the air passage at
some point go that the air escapes making a kind of hissing sound: examples f, z.

**_Semivowels_** or vowels are used in the capacity of consonants, example ‘w’.

**_Affricates_**

An affricate is a single sound composed of a stop portion and a fricative portion. In English [tʃ], the
airflow is first interrupted by a stop which is very similar to [t] (though made a bit further back).
But instead of finishing the articulation quickly and moving directly into the next sound, the tongue
pulls away from the stop slowly, so that there is a period of time immediately after the stop where
the constriction is narrow enough to cause a turbulent airstream.

**_Approximants_**

In an approximant, the articulators involved in the constriction are further apart still than they are
for a fricative. The articulators are still closer to each other than when the vocal tract is in its neutral
position, but they are not even close enough to cause the air passing between them to become
turbulent. The approximants of English are [w], [j], [ɹ], and [l].

1. There are 44 sounds in English language.
2. Out of the 44 sounds, 20 sounds are vowel sounds.
3. Out of the 20 vowel sounds, 12 are monophthongs and 8 are diphthongs.
4. Monophthongs are also referred to as pure vowels.
5. Out of the 44 sounds, 24 sounds are consonant sounds.
6. All sounds except vowel sounds are consonant sounds in English language.

###### 8.4 Voicing in Pronunciation

Voice, also called Full Voice, in phonetics, is the sound that is produced by the vibration of
the vocal cords. All vowels are normally voiced, but consonants may be either voiced or voiceless
( _i.e.,_ uttered without vibration of the vocal cords). The liquid consonant _l_ and the nasal _m, n, ng_ (as
in “sing”) are normally voiced in English, and the stops, fricatives, and affricates characteristically
possess both voiced and voiceless forms. In English, for example, b is a voiced bilabial stop,
whereas p is a voiceless bilabial stop. Of the other stops, fricatives, and affricates, v, d, th (as in
“this”), z, zh (the sound of the s in “pleasure”), j (as in “jam”), and g are normally all voiced sounds;
while f, t, th (as in “thin”), s, sh, ch, and k are all voiceless sounds.

###### 8.5 Aspiration

Aspirate is the sound ‘ _h’_ as in English “hat.” Consonant sounds such as the English voiceless
stops _p, t,_ and _k_ at the beginning of words ( _e.g.,_ “pat,” “top,” “keel”) are also aspirated because they
are pronounced with an accompanying forceful expulsion of air. Such sounds are not aspirated at
the end of words or in combination with certain consonants ( _e.g.,_ in “spot,” “stop”). The voiced
stops _b_ and _d_ in Sanskrit and Hindi also have aspirated forms that are usually transliterated
as _bh_ and _dh._

###### 8.6 Assimilation

Assimilation, where, as a result of phonetic conditioning, one phoneme is effectively replaced by a
second under the influence of a third, we term the process assimilation. Take the English word
broadcast, which in careful pronunciation is //, but in connected speech may well become Here,
one phoneme /d/ has been replaced by a second /g/ under the influence of a third /k.

###### 8.7 Elision

Elision: A change from the ideal form in connected speech may involve the deletion of a phoneme,
e.g. English tasteless

→

The phoneme is said to be elided and the process is termed elision. Frequently, assimilation
processes also involve elision, e.g. English mind-boggling :

###### 8.8 Word Stress

In English, four phonetic variables appear most significant as indicators of stress:

intensity,

1. pitch variation,
2. vowel quality and
3. vowel duration.

**_Intensity in physiological terms_** is the greater breath effort and muscular energy associated
with stressed syllables. It’s closely related to what is perceived by the listener as loudness.

**_Pitch variation_** appears to be, as far as English is concerned, the most important single factor in
determining stress. In English, higher pitch tends to be associated with stronger stress.


```
Vowel quality , i.e. whether a vowel is central or peripheral, also determines stress. Take the
English vowels in the noun present /’present/ as opposed to the verb (to) present /pre’zent/. The
stressed syllables contain the peripheral vowel dress /e/, whereas the unstressed syllables have a
central vowel /Ə/. (Note that in the first word it is possible for the vowel in the unstressed syllable
to be further reduced to a syllabic consonant /n/; in the second word some speakers may use
another non-peripheral vowel, kit.) Diphthongs have a less clearly discernible glide.
```
```
The strongest stress is primary stress (indicated by 1 in the example); the next level, secondary
stress (indicated by 2) – anything else is treated as unstressed. Primary stress is normally shown by
a vertical mark [‘] placed above the line. Where it’s necessary to show a secondary stress, this is
shown by a vertical mark below the line, thus:
```
```
For example, eccen’tricity, expla’nation, ‘cauli,flower, ‘goal,keeper, etc. Note that unstressed
syllables are left unmarked. For most purposes, it is sufficient to show only primary stress, and
from now on we shall normally ignore secondary stresses and also leave them unmarked, e.g.,
cate’gorical, ‘cauliflower, etcetera
```
###### 8.9 Intonation

```
Intonation, in phonetics, is the melodic pattern of an utterance. Intonations are primarily a matter of
variation in the pitch level of the voice but in such languages as English, stress and rhythm are also
involved. Intonation conveys differences of expressive meaning ( e.g., surprise, anger, wariness). In
many languages, including English, intonation serves a grammatical function, distinguishing one
type of phrase or sentence from another. Thus, “Your name is John,” beginning with a medium
pitch and ending with a lower one (falling intonation), is a simple assertion; “Your name is John?”,
with a rising intonation (high final pitch), indicates a question.
```
```
Rules of using Intonation
```
```
It's divided into phrases, also known as 'tone-units'. The pitch moves up and down, within a 'pitch
range'. Everybody has their own pitch range. Languages, too, differ in pitch range. English has
particularly wide pitch range. In each tone unit, the pitch movement (a rise or fall in tone, or a
combination of the two) takes place on the most important syllable known as the 'tonic-syllable'.
The tonic-syllable is usually a high-content word, near the end of the unit. These patterns of pitch
variation are essential to a phrase's meaning. Changing the intonation can completely change the
meaning. Intonation and stress are closely linked. In fact, it's impossible to dissociate them. They go
hand in hand.
```
```
Intonation is about how we say things, rather than what we say, the way the voice rises and falls
when speaking, in other words the music of the language.
```
```
Falling Intonation ( ➘ )
```
```
(The pitch of the voice falls at the end of the sentence.)
Falling intonation is the most common intonation pattern in English.It is commonly found in
statements, commands, wh-questions (information questions), confirmatory question tags and
exclamations.
```
```
Statements
```
1. Nice to meet ↘you.
2. I’ll be back in a ↘minute.
3. She doesn’t live here ↘anymore.
4. Dad wants to change his ↘car.
5. Here is the weather ↘forecast.

```
Commands
```
1. Write your name ↘here.
2. Show me what you’ve ↘written.

3. Leave it on the ↘desk.
4. Take that picture ↘ down.
5. Throw that ↘out.

```
Exclamations
```
1. How nice of ↘ you!
2. That's just what I ↘need!
3. You don't ↘ say!
4. What a beautiful ↘ voice!
5. That's a ↘surprise!

```
Rising Intonation ( ➚ )
```
```
(The pitch of the voice rises at the end of a sentence.)
Rising intonation invites the speaker to continue talking.
It is normally used with yes/no questions, and question tags that are real questions.
```
```
Yes/no Questions
```
```
(Questions that can be answered by 'yes' or 'no'.)
```
1. Do you like your new ➚teacher?
2. Have you finished ➚already?
3. May I borrow your ➚dictionary?
4. Do you have any ➚magazines?
5. Do you sell ➚stamps?

```
Questions tags that show uncertainty and require an answer (real questions).
```
1. We've met already, ➚haven't we?
2. You like fish, ➚don't you?
3. You're a new student ➚aren't you?
4. The view is beautiful, ➚isn't it?

```
We sometimes use a combination of rising and falling intonation in the same sentence.
```
```
The combination is called Rise-Fall or Fall-Rise intonation.
```
```
Rise-Fall Intonation (➚➘)
```
```
(The intonation rises and then falls.)
```
```
We use rise-fall intonation for choices, lists, unfinished thoughts and conditional sentences.
Choices (alternative questions.)
```
```
Are you having ➚soup or ➘salad?
```
```
Is John leaving on ➚Thursday or ➘Friday?
```
```
Does he speak ➚German or ➘French?
```
Unfinished thoughts (partial statements)
In the responses to the following questions, the rise-fall intonation indicates reservation. The speaker
hesitates to fully express his/her thoughts. Do you like my new handbag? Well the ➚leather is ➘nice...
( but I don't like it.) What was the meal like? Hmm, the ➚fish was ➘good... (but the rest wasn't great).
So you both live in Los Angeles? Well ➚Alex ➘does ... (but I don't).


Conditional sentences

(The tone rises in the first clause and falls gradually in the second clause.)

1. If he ➚calls, ask him to leave a ➘message.
2. Unless he ➚insists, I'm not going to ➘go.
3. If you have any ➚problems, just ➘contact us.

```
Fall-Rise Intonation (➘➚)
```
```
(The voice falls and rises usually within one word.
The main function of fall-rise intonation is to show that the speaker is not certain of the answer they
are giving to a question or is reluctant to reply (as opposed to a falling tone used when there is no
hesitation). It is also used in polite requests or suggestions.
```
```
Hesitation/reluctance:
```
1. So, you'd be willing to confirm that? ...Well ... I ➘sup➚pose so ...
2. You didn't see him on Monday? I don't quite ➘re➚member ...

```
Politeness-Doubt-Uncertainty: (You are not sure what the answer might be.)
```
1. Perhaps we could ➘vis➚it the place?
2. Should we ➘cop➚y the list?
3. Do you think it's ➘al➚lowed?

###### Summary

```
Vowels are voiced sounds produced with a stricture of open approximation without any
obstruction, either partial or complete, in the passage of air. Such a definition can help us to
distinguish vowels from consonants (in which there is a partial or complete obstruction in the flow
of air) but cannot help us to distinguish one vowel from another. For this, we have to set up criteria
for the description and classification of vowels. All vowels are normally voiced. We have to
understand two types of differences found in vowels – vowel length and vowel quality. Consider
the English words hit and heat. The vowel sounds in these words differ only in their relative length.
In heat, the vowel sound is longer than in hit. The second difference to consider is the quality of
vowel as is exemplified in the words pool and peel. The vowel in pool is a long, back, high vowel
and in peel, it is a long, front, high vowel. Other important aspects of pronunciation include
consonants, word stress and intonation which play a significant role in the speaking skills.

###### Introduction

```
The British Council reckons that English is spoken at a useful level by some 1.75 billion people, a
quarter of the world’s population. It is taught from primary level up in all China’s schools; it is
the working language of the whole European Union. Beyond doubt, the use of English is greater
than ever, and far more widespread than any other language in the world. All non-English-
speaking powers of our globalised world recognize it as the first foreign language to learn; it is also,
uniquely, in practical use worldwide. Communication is an important aspect of quality of life, and
speech is the primary means of human communication. In adults with intellectual disabilities (ID),
speech communication is often troubled by disordered speech production and/or impaired
hearing, resulting in miscommunication and consequently impairing social interactions, possibly
behavioral problems and isolation. As the significance of the English language is unparalleled, it
becomes imperative to excel in the art of speaking English. Speaking skills consist of fluency,
intelligibility, non-verbal and business communication. Every component entails thorough practice
and revision of rules that govern it.
```
###### 9.1 Fluency

**Introduction to Fluency**

```
As per the Cambridge English dictionary, fluency in any language is the ability to speak or write a
language easily, well and quickly. Speaking fluency is one of the major components in second
language learning. As a result, students need to understand it and speak fluently in order to
express their speaking proficiency.
```
```
Many researchers have an explanation of the meaning of fluency as follows:
```
English Communication Skills


```
Fluency is considered as similar to overall speaking proficiency. Fillmore (1979) states four ways
that help to determine a speaker’s fluency. A speaker must have:
```
1. the ability to speak with few pauses
2. the ability to speak consistently using semantically dense sentences with few unnecessary
    words
3. the ability to know what to say in various contexts and unfamiliar situations
4. the ability to create speech for communication

```
According to Cohen (1994), speakers should have fluency in the language and use vocabulary and
structure in suitable situations. For Beardsmore (1972), oral fluency needs communicative
competence to formulate more than one sentence with accurate and proper pronunciation in real
time. Adding details of sentence structures, choosing and inserting words or vocabulary are
required as well. He states that each sentence has to be combined into connected speech.
```
```
He explains the specific criteria for oral fluency, consisting of:
```
1. fluency (ability to show speakers’ communicative proficiency and to speak naturally and
    continuously)
2. accuracy (structural and lexical
3. relevance, intelligibility, pronunciation, variety of structures and words

```
Fluency is a way that students will be able to speak easily and flowing when compared to native
speakers. Day and Shapson also give more explanations of fluency at four levels. They are:
```
1. stopping, slow speech, noticeable pauses between words, use many attempts
2. uneven speaking, some noticeable pauses between words, seems to require effort, sometimes
    stopping, tend to but not necessarily have slower speech rate than level three
3. relatively smooth and easy speech but speech rate slower than native or recognizably non-
    native
4. relatively smooth, native-like speech rate

**Problems in achieving fluency**

```
There are perceived obstacles which are faced by students when they try to achieve fluency in
English language. Perceived obstacles refer to students’ recognition and understanding of problems
that block them from speaking English fluently. Students who learn to speak the English language
unavoidably experience the same difficulties. Regarding this, there are many barriers that have an
impact on students’ fluency in speaking English.
```
```
Knowledge of vocabulary
```
```
It is accepted that vocabulary knowledge is one of the major factors for successful communication
in language and many researchers have similar For Diamond and Gutlohn (2006), vocabulary is
defined as the knowledge of words and their meanings. They say that if learners lack a strong
vocabulary base first, they will not be able to accomplish understanding and use of language. So,
learners should be able to remember words, and know their meanings and definitions about
vocabulary. Wilkins (1972) states that “...while without grammar very little can be conveyed,
without vocabulary nothing can be conveyed.” This means that a student cannot communicate
effectively because of their weakness of vocabulary knowledge. On the contrary, lacking
knowledge of grammar, he/she can communicate, even though not effectively. Moreover,
vocabulary helps students produce language. According to Hubbard et al. (1983), a student who
knows a large number of word meanings can express accurate meanings as he/she wants to.
Similarly, Cardenas (2001) indicates that vocabulary is used as an important tool to find out how
much a student can communicate successfully. Stewick (1972) mentions that vocabulary knowledge
is one of the most important things in learning a new language. Students who succeed in learning a
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 09: Speaking Skills
```
foreign language are required to have the ability to know the sound system for speaking clearly
and understandably, use correct grammar, and adequate vocabulary. The fundamental unit in
communication is the word. Knowing the estimated 1,000 most frequently used words will satisfy
three-quarters of communicative needs. Two methods to memorize new vocabulary are jotting
down the new words and translating them into the mother language and guessing the meaning
from the context and using a dictionary to find out the different meanings of unfamiliar words.

**_Knowledge of grammar_**

It is one of the key components of speaking English for language learners. Many students who
lack grammar knowledge may feel reluctant to speak English with others. In other words, limited
grammar forms can make a speaker less confident while speaking English. Therefore, the
researchers illustrate similar ways of knowledge of grammar. Hurd et al. (2005) indicate that
grammar knowledge is very important as well, because grammar is a combination of words into a
larger form and a sentence.

Thus, users have to mainly focus on the grammatical structure so as to convey the correct meaning
of what they say because grammar has an effect on meaning. Additionally, Kianiparsa and Vali
(2010) mention that lack of grammatical structure knowledge is one the obstacles of language
learners as they will be unable to understand each other when communicating in a foreign
language without grammatical rules. Apart from the speaker and the listener, messages come from
9 words combined by using nouns and verbs, and correct grammatical structures are necessary for
communication. Students’ needs to arrange a correct sentence to communicate are in line with
Heaton (1978), who suggested students must have the ability to manipulate structure and
discriminate appropriate grammatical forms in appropriate ones. Learners have to learn correct
grammar rules for use in oral and written forms.

**_Pronunciation_**

Pronunciation refers to producing the sounds of speech, including utterance, stress, and intonation
in response to some standard of rightness or acceptability. Gerard (2000) mentions that
pronunciation is the phonological process which enables students to generate clearer spoken
language. It involves grammatical elements and principles that determine how sounds vary and
patterns in a language. Pronunciation consists of phonemes and supra segmental features. A
speaker who fails to pronounce accurately in a range of phonemes has difficulty to make other
people understand what he or she wants to communicate. According to Varasarin (2007), students
with accurate and clear pronunciations can make it easier for people to understand what he or she
wants to communicate, and pronunciation is considered as essential for language learning.
Additionally, Liu (2007) points out that if students’ pronunciation is poor, others will be unable to
clearly understand what they said. So mainly focusing on this linguistic aspect like pronunciation is
also vital for students. Mispronunciation can become students’ obstacle to speak.

**_Listening ability_**

Speaking is always closely related to listening, therefore for people who learn to speak the English
language it is necessary to practice listening skills at the same time. Good listening will be able to
help learners improve their English speaking more effectively. Doff (1998) states that if we develop
listening skills, speaking skills can be developed. To achieve successful communication, students
have to understand what is said to them. In Krashen et al.’s (1983) view, competent speaking is
combined with listening. Speakers can speak fluently in a second language after they have received
productive and understandable input.

**_Anxiety_**

It is regarded as a very negative factor in learning a second language or a foreign language,
especially in learning to speak the language. That is students feel nervous, apprehensive or worry
that disturbs their speaking performance either before or while practicing English speaking in class.
In the explanations of anxiety, there is a difference in meanings between general anxiety and
specific anxiety. General anxiety is part of the personality of individuals who feel worried in
various situations, while specific anxiety means one’s anxiety which occurs only in specific
circumstances, for instance language learning. Additionally, when anxiety is limited to language


```
teaching or learning, it is categorized as specific anxiety. Broadly speaking, anxiety means
individual feelings of stress, apprehension, nervousness and worry associated with a stimulation of
the autonomic nervous system, whereas anxiety is a major barrier to conquer when people are
learning to speak another language. Macintyre and Gardner (1991) say that students with anxiety
will face the problem of learning the language in class, resulting in ineffective performances.
Consequently, they do not want to participate voluntarily in class because of nervousness,
apprehension, and even fearfulness. With such conditions, worried students have no chance to
practice the language. Thus, anxiety has become the major obstacle in developing language skills,
particularly in speaking. They also tend to make more mistakes and fail to perform well in
speaking skills when they are nervous. For Macintyre (1999), language anxiety is the worry and
negative emotional reaction stimulated when learning or using a second language. The mentioned
definitions appear to be widely accepted by many researchers.
```
**Ways to improve fluency in English**

```
Think in English
```
```
Sometimes, the difficult thing about English speaking isn’t the language itself, but how you think
about it. If you think in your native language and then try to speak English, you’ll always have to
translate between languages. Translating isn’t an easy thing to do! Even people fluent in two or
more languages have trouble switching between languages. The solution is to think in English. You
can do this anywhere, anytime. Try to use English when you’re thinking about your day, or when
you’re trying to decide what food to order. Even try to use an English-to-English dictionary to look
up words. That way, you never have to use your native language and translate words. You’ll notice
that when you think in English, it’s easier for you to speak in English.
```
```
Pay Attention to Stressed Sounds
```
```
English uses stresses in words and sentences. That means when you speak English you’ll need to
stress, or emphasize, certain words and syllables (sounds) to give words and sentences different
meanings. Listen to where native speakers place the emphasis when they speak. Try to repeat it the
same way to improve English stress in your own speech. This won’t only help you speak English
well, it might even reduce misunderstandings. Sometimes, placing the stress on the wrong syllable
completely changes the word. The word ADdress, for instance, isn’t the same as the word
adDRESS. ADdress refers to a physical location where someone lives, and adDRESS means to
formally speak to a group of people. Learn to hear—and make for yourself—the difference! In fact,
mastering stressed sounds is essential to making yourself understood and excelling in Business
English. If you can say what you mean in a precise, clear and concrete way, you can succeed in any
job interview, business meeting or presentation.
```
```
Talk to Yourself
```
```
Whenever you’re at home (or alone somewhere else) you can improve English speaking with your
favorite person: yourself If you’re already thinking in English, try speaking your thoughts out
loud. Read out loud, too. Practice is practice, and even if you don’t have anyone to correct your
mistakes, just the act of speaking out loud will help you become more comfortable speaking
English.
```
```
Master English Registers
```
```
In order to communicate effectively in English, you need to know the different
English registers that exist. A register is a different set of words and phrases that you use
depending on the situation you find yourself in. For example, the way you speak English to a friend
is different from the way you would speak to child and that would be different from the English
you would speak in a business meeting. In order to improve your speaking, you need to move
effortlessly between all registers of English. This means you should know what register of English
to use with your friends, at work and with people you meet for the first time.

**_Use a Mirror_**

Whenever you can, take a few minutes out of your day to stand in front of the mirror and speak.
Choose a topic, set a timer for two or three minutes and just talk. The point of this exercise is to
watch your mouth, face and body language as you speak. It also makes you feel like you’re talking
to someone, so you can pretend you’re having a discussion with a study buddy.

```
Shakespeare added over 1,000 words to the English language.
```
1. Addiction — Being psychologically or physically dependent on something, usually a
    drug.
2. Cold-blooded — Either an animal with cold blood (like a reptile) or a way to
    describe someone who’s cruel and indifferent to emotion.
3. Swagger — To walk in a way that shows you’re boasting or disrespectful.
4. Break the ice — To relieve the tension or silence in a conversation by talking.
5. English has more words than most languages.
6. The most commonly used letter in English is “E.”
7. The most commonly used adjective is _good_.
8. The most commonly used noun is _time_.

###### 9.2 Intelligibility

**Introduction to intelligibility**

Speech intelligibility can be defined as how clearly a person speaks so that his or her speech is
comprehensible to a listener. Reduced speech intelligibility leads to misunderstanding, frustration,
and loss of interest by communication partners. Recent perspectives on pronunciation teaching
have been shifting from native-like pronunciation to intelligibility due to the internationalization of
English. Despite a number of research studies exploring intelligibility, defining intelligibility has
still remained varied. Many researchers have agreed upon the complex nature of ESL learners’
intelligibility resulting in challenging their studies. As one of them, Zielinski describes the difficulty
of conducting research on intelligibility, saying “previous research findings related to L2 learners’
intelligibility are sometimes difficult to interpret and compare because intelligibility has been
defined in a range of different ways in the literature. Much earlier, Smith and Nelson (1985) also
reported the difficulty in distinguishing between intelligibility and comprehensibility. In an
attempt to clarify the terms, they defined intelligibility as the extent to which the listener is able to
recognize words /utterances whereas comprehensibility was the listener being able to understand
their meaning. They, however, admitted the interchangeability of intelligibility and
comprehensibility at certain points. Cutler argues that listeners first perceive the phonology of the
speech they hear rather than its lexicon and grammar.In proposing her English as an International
Language, or English as Lingua Franca, standards for pronunciation, Jenkins calls intelligibility
‘phonological intelligibility’. More specifically, she defines intelligibility as ‘the production and
recognition of the formal properties of words and utterances and, in particular, the ability to
produce and receive phonological form. Similarly, Field defined intelligibility as ‘the extent to
which the acoustic phonetic content of the message is recognizable by a listener’. He argues that
intelligibility ‘forms part of a wider construct of comprehensibility’.

**Factors affecting Intelligibility**

**_Background_**

Researchers on intelligibility have held some different opinions about how L1 background affect L2
speakers’ developments in different ways. On the one hand, Derwing and Munro imply that
different L1 backgrounds should not be considered as a major inhibitor of intelligibility. In their
study, they further expanded their 1995 study with Mandarin speakers by varying L1 backgrounds
and proficiency level. Accentedness, perceived comprehensibility, and intelligibility including
accent familiarity ratings, were measured with 48 L2 speakers of Cantonese, Japanese, Polish, and
Spanish backgrounds. Rating scales were used to measure accentedness and comprehensibility
while calculating accuracy rate in listeners’ orthographic transcriptions was measures for


```
intelligibility. The speech materials were excerpted, ranging from 6 to 19 words from continuous
speech. On the other hand, there are the studies indicated that speakers with different L1
backgrounds differ from speaker to speaker in terms of the intelligibility of their speech.
```
```
In Gallego’s study with Korean, Italian and Hindi ITAs, he attributed the perceived unintelligibility
of the Korean TA to the linguistic distance between English and Korean.
```
```
Proficiency
```
```
Munro and Derwing (1995) found that segmental errors, intonation, grammar, and the length of
utterance were found to be related with the listener’s perception on accentedness. They also found
that not segmental errors but nonstandard intonation and ungrammatical phrases affected
perceived comprehensibility. Meanwhile, Derwing and Munro (1997) noted that none of the
segmental errors, intonation, grammar, and the length of utterance were found to be significantly
correlated with accent rating. The different results of the two studies implied that participants’
different proficiency levels may have caused inconsistent results.
```
**Ways to improve Intelligibility**

```
Record your speech
```
```
Making a recording can be a good way of getting a clear picture of someone’s current manner of
speaking and understanding in what ways their intelligibility might be improved. You can do this
using a cell phone or laptop computer either in class or out of it. Answer an open question, talk for
a minute on a topic that you are passionate about or simply tell your friends what you did at the
weekend. Listen to the recordings and analyze your speech. Identify parts with low levels of
intelligibility. This may be related to their pronunciation, how fast you are speaking, the amount of
hesitation, repetition etc. You could even take this a step further by asking another native-level
speaker to listen to the recording and give honest feedback about which parts they found difficult
to understand.
```
```
Listening and Shadowing
```
```
Listening is a very important part of intelligibility. After all, students have to be able to hear a word
before they can actually say it. Listening also takes focus away from how words are written on the
page. This is key because English speakers blend words together, so pronouncing each word
perfectly in isolation is not a good goal to have – this kind of practice just reinforces pronunciation
habits that take us further away from good intelligibility. Shadowing is a useful listen-and-repeat
activity that students can practice almost anywhere. First select some audio for yourself. It should
be under five minutes in length and only be based on the speech of a single proficient English
speaker. TED.com could be a good place to start for more advanced students, with the student
choosing a topic that they are already familiar with, and which is of interest to them. Listen to the
audio to once quickly just to get used to how the speaker sounds. You should pay attention to the
speaker’s rhythm, accent, and pace of speaking. You should be able to understand most of what is
being said.
```
```
Target the problem sounds
```
```
Throughout the lesson, as you listen to others speak, identify a number of words that reflect the
pronunciation challenges your students face. Write the words on the board and group the words by
phoneme, for example:
```
```
/i:/ Heat, Sheep
```
```
/ɪ/ Hit, Trip
```
```
Next, identify the vowel sound in each word and write their phonemic symbols on the board. Drill
the sounds and then the words until you are confident you can repeat them successfully. There are
a number of phonemic charts online, that can help you identify the phonemes and model the
sounds. Then test yourself by calling out a corresponding name after listening to the related
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 09: Speaking Skills
```
number. Then call out a word and get them to tell you the number. Deal with any problems that
arise.

**_Transcribe and drill new vocabulary_**

While problems with individual sounds may occasionally impede understanding, we should also
focus on other aspects of pronunciation such as word stress, sentence stress and intonation. Keep a
note of any new vocabulary that comes up during your class. At the end of the lesson, take five
minutes to review it. Write each new word on the board and record the word stress using the oO
method: Use ‘o’ to highlight unstressed syllables and ‘O’ to highlight stressed syllables. For
example, the stress is on the second syllable of the word “behavior”,

Be-hav-ior = oOo.

This has the advantage of recording unstressed as well as stressed syllables. Next, drill this new
vocabulary until you get the hang of it. To make drilling more interesting, you can also add an
element of drama! Say the words while expressing different emotions. Choose an emotion (e.g.
angry/happy/sad/excited), then have the others guess it.

```
In the words of Rob Brown, “If you can speak, you can influence. If you can influence,
you can change lives.
```
**_Focus on saying all your speech sounds – particularly at the end of words_**

One standard measure of intelligibility is the percentage of sounds you get right. Leaving sounds
out – particularly at the end of words and phrases – makes it much harder for listeners to
understand what you are saying. This is one reason strangers find it hard to understand children
with speech disorders and many adults who speak English as a second language. It’s also why
speech pathologists often target patterns of missing sounds first, and then “wrong sounds” when
treating people with speech disorders and helping people to modify their accents and improve their
communication.

**_Learn about and apply the basic rules of speech “prosody”_**

A focus on prosody – things like speech stress, rhythm and intonation – can lead to greater
comprehensibility than a focus on speech sounds. Sentence stress is probably the most important
thing to get right for intelligibility. This is simply making important words – especially words that
convey new or essential information – longer and louder than the words around them. For
example,

1. I want to go to the BEACH (not the office).
2. They’re coming TOMORROW (not today).
3. The BLACK shoes are missing (not the blue ones).
4. The black SHOES are missing (not the black socks).
5. The black shoes are MISSING (not here).

**_Smooth out the rough edges_**

Hesitations, awkward pauses and repetitions can all hurt your intelligibility – especially if they
make it hard for listeners to tell where different thoughts start and end. Reducing the “ums and
ahs”, and pausing between thoughts at grammatically correct times can increase your intelligibility
dramatically – even if you make the same number of sound errors.

**_Increase your volume_**

Many speech treatments, notably LSVT LOUD, are based on the simple idea that increased volume
will help increase intelligibility. Increasing volume not only makes you louder. It’s also been shown
to increase articulatory precision and breath control. This applies both for people with neurological
diseases like Parkinson’s Disease as well as to chronic mumbles.


(^) **LOVELY PROFESSIONAL UNIVERSITY**
**_Look after your voice_**
Voice quality and resonance can also affect your intelligibility. It can be almost painful listening to
someone with a very rough, strained, breathy or monotone voice. At best, it’s distracting.
**_Slow down_**
Rate control has been described as the most powerful single, behaviorally modifiable variable for
improving intelligibility. However, it’s easier said than done.
**_Pretend you are speaking into a microphone_**
Sounds silly, I know. But there’s evidence to say that some speakers perform better when placed in
front of a microphone. It’s called a “performance effect”. (Incidentally, it’s one reason speech
pathologists can over-estimate a client’s intelligibility when they conduct formal assessments,
usually with the client seated in front of a microphone).
**_Don’t multi-task while speaking_**
Studies of people speaking while balancing a tray, walking around obstacles, standing on tiptoes or
sorting out buttons consistently show that dual or competing tasks negatively affect intelligibility.
Focus on what you are saying!

###### 9.3 Non-Verbal communication

**Introduction to Non-verbal communication**

```
When we talk about ‘communication’, we often mean ‘what we say’: the words that we use.
However, interpersonal communication is much more than the explicit meaning of words, and the
information or message that they convey. It also includes implicit messages, whether intentional or
not, which are expressed through non-verbal behavior.
```
```
Non-verbal communication includes facial expressions , the tone and pitch of the voice, gestures
displayed through body language (kinesics) , the physical distance between the communicators
(proxemics). These non-verbal signals can give clues and additional information and meaning over
and above spoken (verbal) communication. Indeed, some estimates suggest that around 70 to 80%
of communication is non-verbal! Anthropologist Ray Birdwhistell's study of kinesics found
that over 65% of communication is nonverbal. Nonverbal communication, also called manual
language, is the process of sending and receiving messages without using words, either spoken or
written. Similar to the way that italicizing emphasizes written language, nonverbal behavior may
emphasize parts of a verbal message.
```
**Types of Non Verbal communication**

```
Judee Burgoon (1994) has identified seven different nonverbal dimensions:
```
1. Kinesics or body movements including facial expressions and eye contact
2. Vocalics or paralanguage that includes volume, rate, pitch, and timbre
3. Personal appearance
4. Our physical environment and the artifacts or objects that compose it
5. Proxemics or personal space
6. Haptics or touch
7. Chronemics or time

Unit 09: Speaking Skills
```
**_Kinesics_**

The word kinesics comes from the root word kinesis, which means “movement,” and refers to the
study of hand, arm, body, and face movements. Specifically, this section will outline the use of
gestures, head movements and posture, eye contact, and facial expressions as nonverbal
communication.

GESTURES

There are three main types of gestures:

1. Adaptors
2. Emblems
3. Illustrators

**_Eye contact_**

We also communicate through eye behaviors, primarily eye contact. While eye behaviors are often
studied under the category of kinesics, they have their own branch of nonverbal studies
called oculesics, which comes from the Latin word oculus, meaning “eye.” The face and eyes are
the main point of focus during communication, and along with our ears our eyes take in most of the
communicative information around us. The saying “The eyes are the window to the soul” is
actually accurate in terms of where people typically think others are “located,” which is right
behind the eyes. Certain eye behaviors have become tied to personality traits or emotional states, as
illustrated in phrases like “hungry eyes,” “evil eyes,” and “bedroom eyes.”

**_Facial expressions_**

Our faces are the most expressive part of our bodies. Think of how photos are often intended to
capture a particular expression “in a flash” to preserve for later viewing. Even though a photo is a
snapshot in time, we can still interpret much meaning from a human face caught in a moment of
expression, and basic facial expressions are recognizable by humans all over the world. Much
research has supported the universality of a core group of facial expressions: happiness, sadness,
fear, anger, and disgust. The first four are especially identifiable across cultures. Getting to see the
pure and innate expressions of joy and surprise on a baby’s face is what makes playing peek-a-boo
so entertaining for adults. As we get older, we learn and begin to follow display rules for facial
expressions and other signals of emotion and also learn to better control our emotional expression
based on the norms of our culture.

**_Haptics_**

Think of how touch has the power to comfort someone in moment of sorrow when words alone
cannot. This positive power of touch is countered by the potential for touch to be threatening
because of its connection to violence. We probably get more explicit advice and instruction on how
to use touch than any other form of nonverbal communication. A lack of nonverbal communication
competence related to touch could have negative interpersonal consequences; for example, if we
don’t follow the advice we’ve been given about the importance of a firm handshake, a person might
make negative judgments about our confidence or credibility. A lack of competence could have
more dire negative consequences, including legal punishment, if we touch someone
inappropriately (intentionally or unintentionally). Touch is necessary for human social
development, and it can be welcoming, threatening, or persuasive.

There are several types of touch, including functional-professional, social-polite, friendship-warmth
and love-intimacy. At the functional-professional level, touch is related to a goal or part of a routine
professional interaction, which makes it less threatening and more expected. For example, we let
barbers, hairstylists, doctors, nurses, tattoo artists, and security screeners touch us in ways that
would otherwise be seen as intimate or inappropriate if not in a professional context.

**_Vocalics_**

Paralanguage refers to the vocalized but nonverbal parts of a message. Vocalics is the study of
paralanguage, which includes the vocal qualities that go along with verbal messages, such as pitch,


```
volume, rate, vocal quality, and verbal fillers. Pitch helps convey meaning, regulate conversational
flow, and communicate the intensity of a message. Even babies recognize a sentence with a higher
pitched ending as a question. We also learn that greetings have a rising emphasis and farewells
have falling emphasis. Paralanguage provides important context for the verbal content of speech.
```
```
For example, volume helps communicate intensity. A louder voice is usually thought of as more
intense, although a soft voice combined with a certain tone and facial expression can be just as
intense. We typically adjust our volume based on our setting, the distance between people, and the
relationship. Speaking rate refers to how fast or slow a person speaks and can lead others to form
impressions about our emotional state, credibility, and intelligence. As with volume, variations in
speaking rate can interfere with the ability of others to receive and understand verbal messages. A
slow speaker could bore others and lead their attention to wander. A fast speaker may be difficult
to follow, and the fast delivery can actually distract from the message. Speaking a little faster than
the normal 120–150 words a minute, however, can be beneficial, as people tend to find speakers
whose rate is above average more credible and intelligent.
```
```
Proxemics
```
```
Proxemics refers to the study of how space and distance influence communication. We only need
look at the ways in which space shows up in common metaphors to see that space, communication,
and relationships are closely related. For example, when we are content with and attracted to
someone, we say we are “close” to him or her.
```
```
Chronemics
```
```
Chronemics refers to the study of how time affects communication. Time can be classified into
several different categories, including biological, personal, physical, and cultural time. Biological
time refers to the rhythms of living things. Humans follow a circadian rhythm, meaning that we are
on a daily cycle that influences when we eat, sleep, and wake. Remember that early morning
conversations and speeches may require more preparation to get yourself awake enough to
communicate well and a more patient or energetic delivery to accommodate others who may still
be getting warmed up for their day.

###### 9.4 Business Communication

```
Introduction to business communication
```
```
Business communication is the process of sharing information between people within and outside a
company. Effective business communication is how employees and management interact to reach
organizational goals. Its purpose is to improve organizational practices and reduce errors.
```
```
Types of Business Communication
```
```
Internal Business Communication
```
```
Upward communication: Any communication that comes from a subordinate to a manager or from
another person up the organizational hierarchy.
```
```
Downward communication/Managerial communication: Communication that flows from a higher
level in an organization to a lower level is a downward communication. In other words,
communication from superiors to subordinates in a chain of command is a downward
communication.
```
```
Lateral communication/Technical communication: Internal or cross-departmental communication
between coworkers: Communication that takes place at same levels of hierarchy in an organization
is called lateral communication, i.e., communication between peers, between managers at same
levels or between any horizontally equivalent organizational member.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 09: Speaking Skills
```
Diagonal Communication: Communication that takes place between a manager and employees of
other workgroups is called diagonal communication: It generally does not appear on organizational
chart. For instance - To design a training module a training manager interacts with Operations
personnel to enquire about the way they perform their task.

**_External Business Communication_**

External business communication is any messaging that leaves your office and internal staff. It
involves dealing with customers, vendors, or anything that impacts your brand.

All communication in this spectrum is of four types:

1. Getting and receiving instructions and assignments both upward and downward.
2. This includes an effective delegation from one person to another.
3. Most problems in business begin with unclear communications in this area.
4. Sharing and discussing information, including information sharing that goes on in meetings.

When communication fails in this area, it causes tasks to be done improperly or not at all.

###### Summary

As the significance of the English language is unparalleled, it becomes imperative to excel in the art
of speaking English. Speaking skills consist of fluency, intelligibility, non-verbal and business
communication. Every component entails thorough practice and revision of rules that govern it.
Fluency in any language is the ability to speak or write a language easily, well and quickly.
Speaking fluency is one of the major components in second language learning. Speech intelligibility
can be defined as how clearly a person speaks so that his or her speech is comprehensible to a
listener. Reduced speech intelligibility leads to misunderstanding, frustration, and loss of interest
by communication partners. Non-verbal communication includes facial expressions, the tone and
pitch of the voice, gestures displayed through body language (kinesics), the physical distance
between the communicators (proxemics). These non-verbal signals can give clues and additional
information and meaning over and above spoken (verbal) communication. Business
communication is the process of sharing information between people within and outside a
company. Effective business communication is how employees and management interact to reach
organizational goals. Its purpose is to improve organizational practices and reduce errors.

###### Introduction

```
Reading is a multifaceted process involving word recognition, comprehension, fluency, and
motivation. Reading is making meaning from print. It requires that we identify the words in print
which is a process called word recognition, construct an understanding from them – a process
called comprehension, coordinate identifying words and making meaning so that reading is
automatic and accurate – an achievement called fluency. Sometimes you can make meaning from
print without being able to identify all the words. Remember the last time you got a note in messy
handwriting? You may have understood it, even though you couldn't decipher all the scribbles.
Reading is fundamental to writing and research at University, but often gets overlooked – lecturers
assume that students know how to read, and students assume there’s only one way to read – but
neither of these things is necessarily true. There are ways to read that can improve information
processing, can help with building an argument, and importantly for many students, can save lots
of time. "Reading" is the process of looking at a series of written symbols and getting meaning from
them. When we read, we use our eyes to receive written symbols (letters, punctuation marks and
spaces) and we use our brain to convert them into words, sentences and paragraphs that
communicate something to us. Reading can be silent (in our head) or aloud (so that other people
can hear). Reading is a receptive skill - through it we receive information. But the complex process
of reading also requires the skill of speaking, so that we can pronounce the words that we read. In
this sense, reading is also a productive skill in that we are both receiving information and
transmitting it (even if only to ourselves).
```
###### 10.1 Importance of Reading

```
You probably know that even in your own language, reading is regarded as important because it
can be entertaining and educational, can open up new worlds and enrich your life, and can
```
Aneesha Pental, Lovely Prof essional University


```
improve hand-eye co-ordination and enhance social skills. But for learning a foreign language like
English, reading in that language has additional important benefits that can help you learn the
language faster and more completely. Reading is an essential skill for language learners. When
your reading skills improve, your listening, speaking and writing skills improve too. The constant
repetition of words and patterns in reading helps you learn and remember vocabulary and
grammar structures. Reading helps you become familiar with the rhythm of English. Over time it
will start to feel natural, and you will notice when a sentence or phrase doesn't seem right. Unlike
conversation, reading is something you can do on your own. Reading is not expensive, often free.
Good reading skills can improve your other language skills. You need to learn to read before you
can write. Reading is the best way to learn and remember the proper spelling of words. Listening as
you read aloud can help you improve your pronunciation skills.
```
###### 10.2 Reading Skills

```
The four main types of reading skills are:
```
1. Skimming
2. Scanning
3. Intensive
4. Extensive

**Skimming**

```
Skimming is sometimes referred to as gist reading where you’re trying to glance over the material
to grasp the main idea. The way you do this is to read the first and last paragraph and check for any
dark headings. Skimming may help in order to know what the text is about at its most basic level.
You might typically do this with a magazine or newspaper and would help you mentally and
quickly shortlist those articles which you might consider for a deeper read. You might typically
skim to search for a name in a telephone directory. You can reach a speed count of even 700 words
per minute if you train yourself well in this particular method. Skimming will certainly save you a
lot of time as you grasp the main idea of whatever you are reading, but do not expect your
comprehension to be high during the process. However, skimming is useful when your goal is to
preview the text to get a better idea of what it’s about. It will help prepare you for deeper learning.
```
**Scanning**

```
Picture yourself visiting a historical city, guide book in hand. You would most probably just scan
the guide book to see which site you might want to visit. Scanning involves getting your eyes to
quickly scuttle across sentence and is used to get just a simple piece of information. You’ll be
searching for specific words or phrases that will give you more information and answer questions
you may have. Interestingly, research has concluded that reading off a computer screen actually
inhibits the pathways to effective scanning and thus, reading of paper is far more conducive to
speedy comprehension of texts. Something students sometimes do not give enough importance to
is illustrations. These should be included in your scanning. Pay special attention to the introduction
and the conclusion.
```
**Intensive reading**

```
You need to have your aims clear in mind when undertaking intensive reading. Remember this is
going to be far more time consuming than scanning or skimming. If you need to list the chronology
of events in a long passage, you will need to read it intensively. This type of reading is indeed
beneficial to language learners as it helps them understand vocabulary by deducing the meaning of
words in context. Moreover, it helps with retention of information for long periods of time and
knowledge resulting from intensive reading which persists in your long-term memory. This is one
reason why reading huge amounts of information just before an exam does not work very well.
Students tend to do this, and they undertake neither type of reading process effectively, especially
neglecting intensive reading. They may remember the answers in an exam but will likely forget
everything soon afterwards.
```

```
Unit 10: Reading Skills
```
**Extensive reading**

Extensive reading involves reading for pleasure. Because there is an element of enjoyment in
extensive reading, it is unlikely that students will undertake extensive reading of a text they do not
like. It also requires a fluid decoding and assimilation of the text and content in front of you. If the
text is difficult and you stop every few minutes to figure out what is being said or to look up new
words in the dictionary, you are breaking your concentration and diverting your thoughts.

###### 10.3 Components of Reading

Akin to other skills in language learning, reading also has essential components. Without these
components, the reading process is rendered incomplete. You might observe that these components
are common to all language skills.

**Phonemic Awareness**

Phonological awareness is an umbrella term that includes three developmental levels:

1. Word awareness
2. Syllable awareness
3. Onset-rime awareness

Phonemic awareness is the understanding that spoken language words can be broken into
individual phonemes—the smallest unit of spoken language. It is not the same as phonics—
phonemic awareness focuses on the individual sounds in spoken language. As students begin to
transition to phonics, they learn the relationship between a phoneme (sound) and grapheme (the
letter(s) that represent the sound) in written language.

**Phonics**

Phonics is the relationship between the letters (or letter combinations) in written language and the
individual sounds in spoken language. Phonics instruction teaches students how to use these
relationships to read and spell words. The National Reading Panel indicated that systematic
phonics instruction enhances student’s success in learning to read, and it is significantly more
effective than instruction that teaches little or no phonics. Phonics is "a system of teaching reading
that builds on the alphabetic principle, a system of which a central component is the teaching of
correspondences between letters or groups of letters and their pronunciations “. Decoding is the
process of converting printed words to spoken words. Readers use phonics skills, beginning with
letter/sound correspondences, to pronounce words and then attach meaning to them. As readers
develop, they apply other decoding skills, such as recognizing word parts (e.g., roots and affixes)
and the ability to decode multi-syllabic words. Students also learn to apply decoding skills to
irregular words that are almost decodable.

```
Phonemic awareness and phonics are not the same, but instruction in phonemic awareness
and phonics tends to overlap. As students begin their transition to phonics, they learn the
relationship between a phoneme (sound) and grapheme (the letter(s) that represent the
sound) in written language. Phonemic awareness instruction improves phonics skills, and
phonics skills improve phonemic awareness.
```
**Fluency**

Fluent readers are able to read orally with appropriate speed, accuracy, and proper expression. It is
the ability to read as well as we speak and to make sense of the text without having to stop and
decode each word. The National Reading Panel’s research findings concluded that guided oral
reading and repeated oral reading had a significant and positive impact on word recognition,
reading fluency, and comprehension in students of all ages. Fluency is the ability to read "like you
speak." Hudson, Lane, and Pullen define fluency this way: "Reading fluency is made up of at least
three key elements: accurate reading of connected text at a conversational rate with appropriate
prosody or expression." Non-fluent readers suffer in at least one of these aspects of reading: they
make many mistakes, they read slowly, or they don't read with appropriate expression and
phrasing. For many years, educators have recognized that fluency is an important aspect of


```
reading. Reading researchers agree to this. Over 30 years of research indicates that fluency is one of
the critical building blocks of reading, because fluency development is directly related to
comprehension. Many researchers, including Breznitz, Armstrong, Knupp, Lesgold, and Pinnell,
have found that fluency is highly correlated with reading comprehension—that is, when a student
reads fluently, that student is likely to comprehend what he or she is reading. Why are reading
fluency and reading comprehension so highly correlated?
```
```
Dr. S. Jay Samuels, a professor and researcher well known for his work in fluency, put forth a
theory called the automaticity theory. According to Dr. Samuels, people have a limited amount of
mental energy. If you want to multitask or to become proficient at a complex task such as reading,
you first need to master the component tasks so you can do them automatically. For example, a
reader who must focus his or her attention on decoding words may not have enough mental energy
left over to think about the meaning of the text. However, a fluent reader who can automatically
decode the words can instead give full attention to comprehending the text. To become proficient
readers, our students need to become automatic with text so they can pay attention to the meaning.
```
**Vocabulary**

```
Vocabulary development is closely connected to comprehension. The larger the reader’s
vocabulary (either oral or print), the easier it is to make sense of the text. According to the National
Reading Panel, vocabulary can be learned incidentally through storybook reading or listening to
others, and vocabulary should be taught both directly and indirectly. Students should be actively
engaged in instruction that includes learning words before reading, repetition and multiple
exposures, learning in rich contexts, incidental learning, and use of computer technology.
According to Steven Stahl (2005), “Vocabulary knowledge is knowledge; the knowledge of a word
not only implies a definition, but also implies how that word fits into the world.” We continue to
develop vocabulary throughout our lives. Words are powerful. Words open up possibilities, and of
course, that’s what we want for all of our students. Incidental Vocabulary Learning: Most students
acquire vocabulary incidentally through indirect exposure to words at home and at school—by
listening and talking, by listening to books read aloud to them, and by reading widely on their
own. The amount of reading is important to long-term vocabulary development. Intentional
Vocabulary Learning: Students need to be explicitly taught methods for intentional vocabulary
learning. According to Michael Graves (2000), effective intentional vocabulary learning includes:
Learning specific words (rich, robust instruction) to support understanding of texts containing
those words., promoting the development of word consciousness and using word play activities to
engage in learning new words.
```
**Comprehension**

```
Comprehension is the complex cognitive process readers use to understand what they have read.
Vocabulary development and instruction play a critical role in comprehension. The National
Reading Panel determined that young readers develop text comprehension through a variety of
techniques, including answering questions (quizzes) and summarization (retelling the story).
Comprehension, or extracting meaning from what you read, is the ultimate goal of reading.
Experienced readers take this for granted and may not appreciate the reading comprehension skills
required. The process of comprehension is both interactive and strategic. Rather than passively
reading text, readers must analyze it, internalize it and make it their own. In order to read with
comprehension, developing readers must be able to read with some proficiency and then receive
explicit instruction in reading comprehension strategy.
```
```
Strategies to improve comprehension
```
```
Use Prior Knowledge/Previewing
```
```
When students preview text, they tap into what they already know that will help them to
understand the text they are about to read. This provides a framework for any new information
they read.
```
```
Predicting
```
```
When students make predictions about the text they are about to read, it sets up expectations based
on their prior knowledge about similar topics. As they read, they may mentally revise their
prediction as they gain more information.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 10: Reading Skills
```
**_Identifying the Main Idea and Summarization_**

Identifying the main idea and summarizing requires that students determine what is important and
then put it in their own words. Implicit in this process is trying to understand the author’s purpose
in writing the text.

**_Questioning_**

Asking and answering questions about text is another strategy that helps students focus on the
meaning of text. Friends can help by modeling both the process of asking good questions and
strategies for finding the answers in the text.

**_Drawing inferences._**

In order to make inferences about something that is not explicitly stated in the text, students must
learn to draw on prior knowledge and recognize clues in the text itself.

**_Visualizing_**

Studies have shown that students who visualize while reading have better recall than those who do
not. Readers can take advantage of illustrations that are embedded in the text or create their own
mental images or drawings when reading text without illustrations.

**_Spelling_**

Research has shown that learning to spell and learning to read rely on much of the same underlying
knowledge—such as the relationships between letters and sounds—and, not surprisingly, that
spelling instruction can be designed to help children better understand that key knowledge,
resulting in better reading. Catherine Snow et al. (2005, p. 86) summarize the real importance of
spelling for reading as follows: “Spelling and reading build and rely on the same mental
representation of a word. Knowing the spelling of a word makes the representation of it sturdy and
accessible for fluent reading.”

###### 10.4 Different types of texts

**Narrative Texts**

Narrative text is to amuse, entertain and deal with actual or vicarious experience in different ways.
Narrative text also has a powerful story to entertain readers. According to Knaap, narrative is not
simply about entertaining a reading audience, although it generally always does so. It means
narrative is any written English text in which the writer wants to amuse, entertain people, and to
deal with actual or vicarious experience in different way. According to Knapp, the generic structure
of the narrative text is as follows:

- Orientation: sets the scene and introduces the participants, time, and place
- Complication: sets off chain of events that influences what will happen in the story
- Resolution: in which the characters finally sort out the complication

Knapp stated that there are some language features of narrative text. When sequencing people and
events in time and space, narrating typically uses action verbs. For example: went, collecting, saw,
coming. It can also employ temporal verbs; for example, then, after. In action sequences, mainly
action verbs are used, while in reflection/ evaluations, mental verbs (italicized) predominant,
example: didn’t know, wondered. Narratives often use action verbs metaphorically to create
effective images.

**Features of Narrative texts**

1. A narrative text tells a story from a particular point of view and can be presented using words,

```
images or/and sounds.
```

2. Its purpose is to narrate the events, entertain and engage the reader in an imaginative

```
experience.
```
3. Narratives can also be used to teach, persuade or inform the reader.

```
Folktales, Fairytales, Traditional tales, Aboriginal dreaming stories, Myths and legends,
Ballads, Play scripts, Picture books, Short stories, Mysteries, Science fiction stories,
Adventure stories
```
**Linguistic features of a Narrative text**

It is important while writing a narrative to develop a ‘personal voice’ or unique style. This involves
making language choices that help to convey new and interesting plots, characters and events.
When writing a narrative, the author must decide how to use language to develop the subject
matter and storyline and focus the audience’s attention. For example, by choosing an interesting
sequence of events and gradually revealing relevant details and drawing together elements of the
storyline at a particular moment in an original way.

**Types of Narrative texts**

**_Descriptive narrative_**

Descriptive narrative connects imagery, ideas and details to convey a sense of time and place. It has
two key purposes that is to create a sense of setting, of time and place and to convey the mood and
tone of said time and place (e.g. threatening, peaceful, cheerful, chaotic). When we describe a
pastoral scene in a rural setting, for example, we might linger on specific images (such as a wide,
empty field, an abandoned tractor) to build up an overarching mood (such as peaceful simplicity).

```
The city, his city, stood unchanging on the edge of time: the same burning dry city of his
nocturnal terrors and the solitary pleasures of puberty, where flowers rusted and salt
corroded, where nothing had happened for four centuries except a slow aging among
withered laurels and putrefying swamps. In winter sudden devastating downpours
flooded the latrines and turned the streets into sickening bogs.
```
**_Viewpoint Narrative_**

Often, the express purpose of a section of narration is to help us understand the views and feelings
of the narrating character or ‘viewpoint narrator’. Point of view or POV is thus a key element
of narration. Viewpoint narrative presents events or scenes to us so that we see understand them
through narrators’ feelings, desires, beliefs or values. In omniscient narration, the narrator is able to
share multiple characters’ private thoughts, even in a single scene. In limited narration, by contrast,
we can only see events through a single person’s eyes at a time. Viewpoint narrative has power. We
might interpret story events the way the narrator does because we don’t have a different viewpoint
for comparison, or because their voice is strong, self-assured. Yet the viewpoint narrator in a scene
may be unreliable (they could lie about what truly happened, or gloss over details that, for
example, make them look worse to others). Authors like Vladimir Nabokov have written novels
featuring protagonists who are unethical or even abusive. In novels such as Nabokov’s Lolita, the
reader has to remember that the narrating voice has its own agenda.

```
‘Human nature, in short, was on him – the repulsive brute, with the blood-red nostrils.
Holmes was on him. Dr. Holmes came quite regularly every day. Once you stumble,
Septimus wrote on the back of a postcard, human nature is on you. Holmes is on you.
Their only chance was to escape, without letting Holmes know; to Italy – anywhere,
anywhere, away from Dr. Holmes.’ ‘But Rezia could not understand him. Dr. Holmes
was such a kind man. He was so interested in Septimus. He only wanted to help them,
she said.’
```

**_Historical Narrative_**

In genres such as biography, autobiography and various historical subgenres (e.g. historical
romance or WWII fiction), a lot of narration recounts events in the past. Of course, the author may
choose to tell a war story in a tumultuous present tense. There’s no single way to narrate the
past. One thing common to historical narrative in different genres is it shows historical process. It
links causation from event to event, showing the chain reactions that lead to how things pan out.
This is why in historical narrative, such as narration sharing a character’s back story, we often
have words showing order of events.

```
‘Rahel was first blacklisted in Nazareth Convent at the age of eleven, when she was
caught outside her Housemistress’s garden gate decorating a knob of fresh cowdung
with small flowers. At Assembly the next morning, she was made to look up depravity in
the Oxford Dictionary and read aloud its meaning.’
```
**Descriptive Text**

A descriptive text usually focuses on describing a single location, object, event, person, or place. It
endeavors to engage all five of the reader’s senses to evoke the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and
feel of the text’s subject. Descriptive text shows, through careful observation, how a thing is done (a
place, a person, an animal), highlighting the features, qualities, distinctive aspects, in order to
furnish a clear and complete conception. The main objective of the descriptive text is to inform: it is
the case of technical descriptions in scientific encyclopedias, handbooks, dictionaries, guides. This
kind of text can also express, through a description, feelings, emotions or moods, in this case serves
an expressive purpose. This kind of text is widespread in all areas of social life. They are often
placed within a narrative, expository or argumentative context. Any text, be it journalistic writing,
advertising, scientific manual, etc contains one or more descriptive parts. Descriptive texts,
although with some variation depending upon the object described, the communication, situation
and the purpose for which they are produced, have, in their structure, some general characteristics.

**Structure of a descriptive text**

The referent is the thing, person or animal described. The quality and the parties are the elements of
the referent listed in the description. To provide a clear picture of the object, it is necessary to make
specific references. Description can be done in a personal or impersonal manner. The former is
called subjective description. The latter is called objective description. In subjective description,
authors propose the referent of the description from their points of view; giving a representation
filtered through their particular ways of seeing and feeling the reality around them. This is done in
order to arouse similar emotions in the reader. The main purpose of this kind of descriptive text is
persuasive or emotional. In an objective description, an author does not express emotions or
personal judgments, introducing the referent in an impersonal and objective way. The primary
purpose of this kind of text is informative.

**Linguistic features of Narrative text**

The main characteristics of a descriptive text from a linguistic point of view are as follows:

1. The use of spatial indicators: adverbs, prepositions, adverbial phrases (front, back, bottom, top,

```
right, left, etc) which are essential in the description of a place, a person, for the placement of
an object in space for the definition of the parts that make it up.
```
2. The use of adjectives, indicating the quality of the contact person.
3. The use of short sentences, for clarity of description.
4. The use of verbs, in simple present and past forms.
5. The richness and variety in the use of terms, which is essential to provide a clear, accurate and

```
representative conception of the referent and its components.
```

```
Techniques in a Descriptive Text
```
```
Depending on the subject to describe the purpose and referent, techniques also vary for the same
description. A discriminating factor is surely the point of view from which you choose to observe
and describe reality (a window onto courtyard, the top floor of a palace, the center of a square). You
can choose a particular criterion of order, spatial or hierarchical, according to which you can set the
description.
```
**Features of a good narrative text**

```
It is concrete. Descriptive writing has to offer specifics the reader can envision. Rather than “Her
eyes were the color of blue rocks” (Light blue? Dark blue? Marble? Slate?), try instead, “Her eyes
sparkled like sapphires in the dark.” It is evocative. Descriptive writing has to unite the concrete
image with phrasing that evokes the impression the writer wants the reader to have. Consider “her
eyes shone like sapphires, warming my night” versus “the woman’s eyes had a light like sapphires,
bright and hard.” Each phrase uses the same concrete image, then employs evocative language to
create different impressions. It is plausible. Descriptive writer has to constrain the concrete,
evocative image to suit the reader’s knowledge and attention span. “Her eyes were brighter than
the sapphires in the armrests of the Tipu Sultan’s golden throne, yet sharper than the tulwars of his
cruelest executioners” will have the reader checking their phone halfway through.” “Her eyes were
sapphires, bright and hard” creates the same effect in a fraction of the reading time. As always in
the craft of writing: when in doubt, write less.
```
**Writing a descriptive text**

- SELECT A TOPIC
- Generally, descriptive texts are narrow in focus. This allows for an in-depth exploration of
    the subject.
- If ever the old adage shows, don’t tell applied to a writing genre, descriptive texts are it.
- Be sure that the topic is something that can sustain your interest, as well as the reader’s
    interest.
- Descriptive essays require the writer to go into great depth to evoke the person, place, or
    thing. If the writer doesn’t care about the topic, then for sure the reader won’t either.
- A good starting point for many students is to write about something that is very personal
    to them.
- For example, childhood memories, embarrassing moments, or a favorite holiday all make
    for good topics.
- As the purpose of a descriptive text is to describe something so vividly, and to express
    emotion so clearly, that the reader can feel it too, personal topics can provide the perfect
    material for this type of essay.
- It is easier for us to describe those things we have intimate knowledge of.
- This is why memories make such rich fodder for this type of essay.
- We can think back to what things looked like, sounded like, smelled like, tasted like, and
    felt like.
- We can conjure in our mind’s eye what it was like to experience that memory at the time,
    making it easier for us to recreate it again in the minds of our readers.
- It is worth investing some time to select a suitable topic for a descriptive text.
- A well-chosen topic can go a long way to kick starting some good writing.
- To avoid this, it is essential that you narrow down which aspects of your selected topic
    your essay will concern itself with.
- An effective means of doing this is by writing a thesis statement.
- The thesis statement lays out the specific purpose of the text and usually it is embedded in
    the introductory paragraph.

Example of Descriptive Text about Experience in Waterfall
```
```
Lembah Pelangi Waterfall sounds unfamiliar for either local or foreign tourists. The soft
flowing gurgling waterfall sounds is like a chant of nature which can remove the
tiredness of the long trip to go there. In this place, you will be shown a panorama of
natural beauty which is very interesting for every pair of eyes seeing it.
```
**Extrapolative Text**

An extrapolation is kind of like an educated guess or a hypothesis. When you make
an extrapolation, you take facts and observations about a present or known situation and use them
to make a prediction about what might eventually happen. Extrapolation comes from the
word extra, meaning “outside,” and a shortened form of the
word interpolation. Interpolation might sound like a made-up word, but it’s not. An interpolation
is an insertion between two points. So, an extrapolation is an insertion outside any existing points.
If you know something about Monday and Tuesday, you might be able to make an extrapolation
about Wednesday. To extrapolate is to use facts already known from a piece of text for another
situation. This situation may be outside the text, but the text will provide you with a springboard to
make use of the information. Extrapolation means to make inferences and assumptions based on
the given information. Sometimes the answer to a question is not directly stated in the text. In such
cases, you should read the text carefully and then make an inference based on what you have read.
To extrapolate is to take what you learn in one place or one text and apply it to a different context,
one that perhaps seems to bear little resemblance to the original context.

**Strategies to decode an extrapolative text**

You can adopt inferential comprehension in order to understand an extrapolative text in a better
way. Inferential comprehension is the ability to process written information and understand the
underlying meaning of the text. This information is then used to infer or determine deeper meaning
that is not explicitly stated. Inferential comprehension requires readers to combine ideas, draw
conclusions, interpret and evaluate information, identify tone and voice. A higher and more
complex level of comprehension involves critical analysis which requires readers to be critical, form
opinions, identify authors' points of view and attitudes, identify and consider the authority of texts
and their messages, infer motives of characters and themes.

```
In the words of Barack Obama, “Reading is the gateway skill that makes all other
learning possible.”

###### Summary

"Reading" is the process of looking at a series of written symbols and getting meaning from them.
When we read, we use our eyes to receive written symbols (letters, punctuation marks and spaces)
and we use our brain to convert them into words, sentences and paragraphs that communicate
something to us. A narrative is a spoken or written account of connected events; a story, the
practice or art of telling stories and a representation of a particular situation or process in such a
way as to reflect or conform to an overarching set of aims or values. Reading helps you become
familiar with the rhythm of English. Over time it will start to feel natural and you will notice when
a sentence or phrase doesn't seem right. Unlike conversation, reading is something you can do on
your own. Reading is not expensive, often free. A descriptive text usually focuses on describing a
single location, object, event, person, or place. It endeavors to engage all five of the reader’s senses
to evoke the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and feel of the text’s subject. Extrapolation means to
make inferences and assumptions based on the given information. Sometimes the answer to a
question is not directly stated in the text. In such cases, you should read the text carefully and then
make an inference based on what you have read.

###### Introduction

```
Reading should not be an academic task but a habit, especially for budding learners of English
language. Reading comprehension entails a myriad of skills which are imperative for the successful
interpretation of texts. The skill set comprises decoding, fluency and vocabulary that helps to get
rid of many hurdles faced during the comprehension of any kind of text. When readers are able to
inculcate this skill set in their everyday reading, the reading becomes a pleasant experience instead
of a mechanical process. Most of the avid readers implement these skills rigorously so that they can
not only read properly but also effectively.
```
###### 11.1 Decoding

**What is decoding?**

```
Decoding is a key skill for learning to read that involves taking apart the sounds in words
(segmenting) and blending sounds together. It requires both knowledge of letter-sound
relationships, as well as an ability to apply that knowledge to successfully identify written words
and make meaning. Decoding is essential to reading. It allows students to figure out most words
they’ve heard but have never seen in print, as well as sound out words they’re not familiar with.
The ability to decode is the foundation upon which all other reading instruction—fluency,
vocabulary, reading comprehension, etc are built. Decoding is the process of translating print into
speech by rapidly matching a letter or combination of letters (graphemes) to their sounds
(phonemes) and recognizing the patterns that make syllables and words. There is an area in the
```
Aneesha Pental, Lovely Prof essional University


```
brain that deals with language processing and does this process automatically. Unfortunately,
about 30 percent of students do not access this part of their brain and therefore must be taught
decoding strategies very explicitly and systematically, meaning that we start with the simplest
sound/letter concept and build to the more complex. This method of phonics instruction has been
proven to be the most effective in helping students gain decoding skills. Adapted in the early stages
of reading, decoding is one’s ability to phonetically understand what they are looking at as far as
the written language goes. Improving decoding ability is the best way to improve a
beginner’s reading skills. This encompasses “sounding-out” basic letters and word sounds and is
largely done through the application of knowledge regarding letter-sound relationships through
speaking them out loud, and in your head.
```
```
Decoding is done through demonstrating such skills as knowledge of letter patterns (how letters
sound when placed next to each other, which varies widely under their chosen language or dialect),
knowledge of common words, vs. words which need to be sounded out, and common patterns
within new words such as the use of the c-h sound, the s-h sound, and the e-a sound, and so on -- at
least in the English language. To decode is to make sounds to figure out what a word (especially a
new one) says. Decoding becomes more difficult as readers encounter words that might sound
different from what a beginner might expect given any of the individual letters by themselves.
```
```
Decoding is a reading skill that encompasses all the strategies which are used in the cognitive
process to correctly pronounce written words-- from sounding them out to understanding the
letter-sound relationship and letter pairing dynamics.
```
**Phonemic Awareness**

```
Phonemic Awareness is a student’s ability to hear, identify, and when speaking - to manipulate the
smallest parts of sounds in a word that might make a difference to a word meaning. Those learning
to read print will need to become more aware of how the sounds in each word work, including
their similarities and differences regarding the new sentence context. In order to sound words out
more easily, developing phonemic awareness will be vitally important, because it is an important
part of the process discussed previously; the process of decoding. Those learning to read must
understand that words are made up of speech sounds, or phonemes, as they are called, in order to
progress their abilities. Hence, the terminology Phonemic Awareness.
```
```
How can one improve phonemic awareness?
```
```
One can practice the following ways to improve the phonemic awareness:
```
1. Identify and categorize sounds.
2. Blend sounds to form words.
3. Delete or add sounds to form new words.
4. Substitute sounds to make new words.
5. Learn root words, as well as prefix and suffix words, as well as affix words which are common
    to your primary language.

**Improving Decoding Skills**

```
Build a strong foundation for phonological awareness
```
```
The first thing to keep in mind is the importance of a strong foundation of phonological awareness.
Students need to be able to hear the differences between two sounds, break a word into its
individual sounds and blend those sounds. Research has shown us that effective phonological
awareness instruction not only involves instruction in advanced phonemic awareness concepts
such as manipulating phonemes but learning these phonological skills to the point of over learning
and automaticity is significant.

Unit 11: Essential Skills for Reading Comprehension
```
**_Learn Syllable Types and Syllable Division_**

When you face an unknown word, this decoding strategy should be your first step. By locating
vowels, then syllable divisions and determining syllable types, students are able to break a word
into bite size pieces. This is an area in which many interventions fall short. Students learn to break a
word into syllables orally, but not how to divide the printed word.

**_Marking vowels_**

The vowels are the trickiest parts of most words for most students. By locating and marking the
vowels, it not only facilitates syllable division, but also pronunciation and decoding. It is often
useful to learn the breve and macron markings so that you can mark vowels with the correct sound.
Saying the vowel sound before attempting to blend the word is often also helpful.

**_Looking for familiar spelling patterns_**

Looking for familiar spelling patterns such as digraphs, blends, or chunks is also a key skill to aid
when decoding words. Students may make connections from known words to new words that
share the same spelling pattern.

If a student is familiar with the word cold, it will assist them in reading a word like withhold or
golden. It is also helpful if students recognize patterns like silent letters, as in the word write,
gnome or knight, as a predictable pattern.

**_Segmenting and blending_**

It is important for students to be proficient at both segmenting and blending as a phonemic
awareness skill done orally before different spelling patterns are introduced. If a student does not
know how to blend, they will not have the necessary skills to decode unknown words. Similarly,
the ability to segment a word into sounds is crucial for spelling.

**_Identifying Affixes, base words and roots_**

In addition to breaking a word into syllables, the ability to locate and understand affixes, base
words and roots is a critical part of reading and spelling more complicated words. This
understanding is very often a key not only for spelling, but also for pronunciation of words and
word parts. This is especially helpful for decoding multisyllabic words.

**_Reinforce the use of meaning clues to self-monitor and confirm_**

Even the most proficient reader when decoding words is going to need to use context clues to read
and understand heteronyms, words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently and with
different meanings. Examples include: sow (female pig, plant seeds), wind (breeze/roll up), bow
(ribbon, front of a boat).

**_Use your fingers to mask words and word parts_**

Although marking up a word with pencil or even colour is undoubtedly helpful, there are times in
every student’s life when this sort of text marking is not an option. Covering suffixes or syllables
with your fingers is an excellent substitute that makes decoding instruction more multisensory and
less visually overwhelming.

**_Trace unknown syllables or tricky word parts_**

If you are struggling with decoding a particular word part, trace that part on the table or desk as
they say the sounds. Not only does tracing make the word part more memorable, but the act of
tracing triggers the kinaesthetic and sensory pathways you utilized when you initially learned a
word or phonogram.


**Importance of Decoding**

```
Since decoding involves phonics and phonemic awareness, let us first understand the benefits we
reap out of phonics. Phonics is important in learning to read and write because letter-sound
knowledge is the foundation needed to build up reading and writing abilities. Written language is
like a code that kids must crack and phonics is the key to cracking it. Research clearly shows
phonics to be a cornerstone of effective early reading instruction. Phonics enables beginning
readers to decode unknown written words by sounding them out, which is an essential skill for
independent reading. This is especially important given that most all printed words are unfamiliar
to beginning grade learners. Knowing the sounds of letters and letter combinations also helps
students to know which letters to use for the sounds they hear in words they want to write. The
National Reading Panel explains the goal of phonics instruction as providing students with the
knowledge and ability to use the alphabet to make progress in learning to read, write, and
comprehend. Phonics instruction helps the learners to decode words by associating sounds to
letters and letter patterns, increases fluency and reading accuracy, boosts reading comprehension. It
helps to increase vocabulary.
```
###### 11.2 Fluency

**What is fluency?**

```
Fluency is defined as the ability to read and comprehend with some speed, accuracy, and proper
expression. As such, it is an extension of reading comprehension in a way, though it is a little bit
narrower in definition. In order to understand all of what you read while reading quickly, you
must be able to read fluently - and the language you are using must begin to come naturally to you.
In order to assure that this happens is a matter of a few disciplines which can be practiced every
day (reading signs, reading newspapers or book titles out loud, and under the supervision and so
on) and being asked questions about what you read. If you struggle, this means you are not yet
fluent. The more common vocabulary you develop, and the more you are able to communicate
what you’ve read, the more fluent you are becoming. Just keep practicing, and fluency will
eventually arrive for most students through repetition. When calling the names of things they’ve
read out, you will often have fun. Lessons must be taken in sequence, regardless of where they
come from, and the more enjoyable you find them, the related repetition of material, the better you
will take on lessons by yourselves, especially later in life. Students who do not read with fluency
sound choppy and awkward. Those students may have difficulty with decoding skills or they may
just need more practice with speed and smoothness in reading. Fluency is also important for
motivation; students who find reading laborious tend not to want read. As readers head into upper
college grades, fluency becomes increasingly important. The volume of reading required in the
college/university years escalates dramatically. Students whose reading is slow or labored will
have trouble meeting the reading demands of their grade level.
```
**Problems associated with fluency**

```
Students will usually express their frustration and difficulties in a general way, with statements
like "I hate reading!" or "This is stupid.” But if they could, this is how students might describe how
fluency difficulties in particular affect their reading:
```
1. I just seem to get stuck when I try to read a lot of the words in this chapter.
2. It takes me so long to read something.
3. Reading through this book takes so much of my energy, I can't even think about what it means.
4. You know how to read words but seem to take a long time to read a short book or passage
    silently.
5. You read a book with no expression.
6. You stumble a lot and lose your place when reading something aloud.
7. You read aloud very slowly.
8. You move your mouth when reading silently (sub vocalizing).
9. Your results on words-correct-per-minute assessments are below grade level or targeted
    benchmark.

English Communication Skills

10. You have difficulty and grow frustrated when reading aloud, either because of speed or

```

```
11. You do not read aloud with expression; that is, you do not change your tone where

```
appropriate.
```
12. You do not "chunk" words into meaningful units.
13. When reading, you do not pause at meaningful breaks within sentences or paragraphs

**Improving fluency in reading**

1. Track the words with your finger as a parent or teacher reads a passage aloud.
2. Then you read it.
3. Have a parent or teacher read aloud to you.
4. Then, match your voice to theirs.
5. Read your favorite books and poems over and over again.
6. Practice getting smoother and reading with expression.
7. Three techniques can be used very frequently with a variety of texts to help maintain and
    develop students' reading fluency:
8. Choral reading, cloze reading, and partner reading.
9. All of these procedures can be used with readers at any grade level, with small or large
    groups, and with fiction or content-heavy nonfiction materials.
10. Two additional techniques can also be considered for use:
11. Readers' Theater and poetry readings
12. For choral reading, the teacher and students read aloud together, following the teacher's
    pace-so students get the benefit of a model while they practice reading aloud.
13. The teacher can stop at any time to ask questions, comment on the text, discuss a
    vocabulary term, or remind the class that she expects everyone to be reading.
14. If choral reading is used with heterogeneously grouped students, it is possible that the
    lowest performing students may have difficulty keeping up with even a moderate pace.
15. However, they can follow along, participating when they can, and still hear the text being
    read accurately and with good pacing and phrasing.
16. If choral reading is used with heterogeneously grouped students, it is possible that the
    lowest performing students may have difficulty keeping up with even a moderate pace.
17. However, they can follow along, participating when they can, and still hear the text being
    read accurately and with good pacing and phrasing.
18. Choral reading works best if the teacher directs all students-regardless of age or ability
    level-to use a marker or finger to follow along in the text as they read.
19. Cloze reading is similar to choral reading, except that the teacher does most of the oral
    reading while the students read along silently.

###### 11.3 Vocabulary

Vocabulary refers to the words we must understand to communicate effectively. Educators often
consider four types of vocabulary: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Listening vocabulary
refers to the words we need to know to understand what we hear. Speaking vocabulary consists of
the words we use when we speak. Reading vocabulary refers to the words we need to know to
understand what we read. Writing vocabulary consists of the words we use in writing. Vocabulary
plays a fundamental role in the reading process, and contributes greatly to a reader's
comprehension. A reader cannot understand a text without knowing what most of the words mean.
Students learn the meanings of most words indirectly, through everyday experiences with oral and
written language. Other words are learned through carefully designed instruction. Vocabulary is


```
crucial to reading comprehension. Readers cannot understand what they are reading without
knowing what most of the words mean. As students learn to read more advanced texts, they must
learn the meaning of new words that are not part of their oral vocabulary. The scientific research on
vocabulary instruction reveals that most vocabulary is learned indirectly and that some vocabulary
must be taught directly. Thus, research supports using a combination of both indirect and direct
approaches.
```
```
Indirect vocabulary learning
```
```
Students learn the meanings of most words indirectly, through everyday experiences with oral and
written language. Students learn word meanings indirectly in the following three ways:
```
1. They engage daily in oral language
2. They listen to adults read to them
3. They read extensively on their own

**Direct Vocabulary Learning**

```
Although a great deal of vocabulary is learned indirectly, some vocabulary should be taught
directly. Direct instruction helps students learn difficult words, such as words that represent
complex concepts that are not part of the students' everyday experiences. Direct instruction of
vocabulary relevant to a given text leads to better reading comprehension. Direct Instruction
Includes. Providing students with instruction in specific words that are important to students’
content learning or understanding of a particular text. Teaching students more general word-
learning strategies that they can apply to a variety of words, such as analyzing parts of words (e.g.,
root words). Students will usually express their frustration and difficulties in a general way, with
statements like "I hate reading!" or "This is stupid!". But if they could, this is how students might
describe how their vocabulary difficulties affect their reading: I heard my friend tell what happened
in the movie but I didn't really understand what he said about it. I feel like I just use the same
words over and over again in my writing. I don't like to read on my own because I don't
understand lots of the words in the book. You have questions about a lot of word meanings in a
grade appropriate text. You seem to have a weak vocabulary. You are not able to make connections
among words in various texts. You are often not able to find the right word to describe something.
```
**Improving Vocabulary**

```
Word Learning Strategies
```
```
Of course, it is not possible for teachers to provide specific instruction for all the words their
students do not know. Therefore, students also need to be able to determine the meaning of words
that are new to them but not taught directly to them. They need to develop effective word-learning
strategies. Word-learning strategies include:
```
1. How to use dictionaries and other reference aids to learn word meanings and to deepen
    knowledge of word meanings;
2. How to use information about word parts to figure out the meanings of words in text; and
3. How to use context clues to determine word meanings.

```
Using Dictionaries and Other Reference Aids
```
```
Students must learn how to use dictionaries, glossaries, and thesauruses to help broaden and
deepen their knowledge of words, even though these resources can be difficult to use. The most
helpful dictionaries include sentences providing clear examples of word meanings in context.
```
```
Using Word Parts
```
```
Word parts include affixes (prefixes and suffixes), base words, and word roots. Affixes are word
parts that are "fixed to" either the beginnings of words (prefixes) or the ending of words (suffixes).
The word disrespectful has two affixes, a prefix (dis-) and a suffix (-ful). Base words are words
from which many other words are formed. For example, many words can be formed from the base
word migrate: migration, migrant, immigration, immigrant, migrating, migratory. Word roots are
the words from other languages that are the origin of many English words. About 60% of all
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 11: Essential Skills for Reading Comprehension
```
English words have Latin or Greek origins. Knowing some common prefixes and suffixes (affixes),
base words, and root words can help students learn the meanings of many new words. For
example, if students learn just the four most common prefixes in English (un-, re-, in-, dis-), they
will have important clues about the meaning of about two thirds of all English words that have
prefixes. Prefixes are relatively easy to learn because they have clear meanings (for example, un-
means "not" and re- means "again"). They are usually spelled the same way from word to word;
and, of course, they always occur at the beginnings of words. Learning suffixes can be more
challenging than learning prefixes. This is because some suffixes have more abstract meanings than
do prefixes. For example, learning that the suffix -ness means "the state or quality of" might not
help students figure out the meaning of kindness. Other suffixes, however, are more helpful, for
example, -less, which means "without" (hopeless, thoughtless); and -ful, which means "full of"
(hopeful, thoughtful). Latin and Greek word roots are found commonly in content-area school
subjects, especially in the subjects of science and social studies.

As a result, Latin and Greek word parts form a large proportion of the new vocabulary that
students encounter in their content-area textbooks. Students should teach the word roots as they
occur in the texts they read and likely to see more often.

**_Using context clues_**

Context clues are hints about the meaning of an unknown word that are provided in the words,
phrases, and sentences that surround the word. Context clues include definitions, restatements,
examples, or descriptions. Because students learn most word meanings indirectly, or from context,
it is important that they learn to use context clues effectively. Some contexts give little information
about a word's meaning. An example of an unhelpful context is the sentence, "We heard the back
door open, and then recognized the buoyant footsteps of Uncle Larry." A number of possible
meanings of buoyant could fit this context, including heavy, lively, noisy, familiar, dragging,
plodding, and so on. Instruction in using context clues as a word-learning strategy should include
the idea that some contexts are more helpful than others.

```
In the words of Aldous Huxley, “ Every man who knows how to read has it in his power
to magnify himself, to multiply the ways in which he exists, to make his life full,
significant and interesting.”
```
Building up your vocabulary is one of the key things to further improving your general reading
comprehension. The more you read, the better you get at understanding the context in which the
words are used. And to understand the context is far more important to proper comprehension
than going through the dictionary and memorizing mechanically all the words that you probably
will never use or ever see them written somewhere. Using big and fancy words wrongly might
even destroy your reputation in front of other people and make you appear like a real clown. Leave
that to the writers and the people who actually know what they’re talking about. Language is a tool
that was invented to communicate clearly with each other, to share ideas, and to solve problems.
There is no point in complicating the way you speak or write, just to appear that you have a rich
vocabulary. Improving your vocabulary takes a lot of time and a lot of reading. While reading, take
notes of the new words that appear often and don’t just memorize them; study the context in which
they are used deeply. What do they mean? Where and when can we use these new words? Is it
necessary to use this new word instead of an easier synonym in order to make a clear point?

To appear that you have a rich vocabulary,

**_Read_**

Instead of watching that soap opera or talent show, grab a good book and sit down for a few hours.
Put away all the stuff that distracts you such as your laptop, phone, or the TV. Highlight the words
that you don’t understand so that you can come back at them later on.

**_Keep Notes_**

Whenever you find interesting words that are used in order to describe something more easily,
write them down somewhere (have a notebook just for new words). Writing the words down will
help you remember them.


```
Write
```
```
When you’re put into a position where you have to explain something or communicate ideas,
you’re forced to use new words in order to be clear and help other people understand you. Start
writing about something that you’re passionate about and use new words that you’ve stumbled
upon before.
```
```
Get Interested In New Things
```
```
Many of the new words that you probably don’t know are related to some specific fields or topics
so try and explore different areas that you don’t know anything about. You will learn lots of new
words and, even better, you’ll gain knowledge on a topic previously unknown to you. A good
vocabulary is fundamental to reading comprehension and effective written and oral
communication. Adults who improve their vocabulary will be able to write more precisely and
clearly communicate their ideas. Improving vocabulary is as easy as reading and doing some
pleasurable activities like word puzzles. Adults with a good vocabulary read faster than those who
have a more limited vocabulary. Reading and writing skills will improve as well, which can be
beneficial in your job. Do crossword puzzles to improve vocabulary. Crossword puzzles are
available for free download at a number of sites on the Internet. Bookstores offer crossword puzzle
books and most newspapers print a daily or weekly crossword puzzle. Use a dictionary and a
thesaurus when reading. When you read a new word, immediately look it up in the dictionary.
Next, use the thesaurus to find synonyms and antonyms for the word. By using a thesaurus in
addition to the dictionary, you will increase your vocabulary by learning several new words at
once. Write down new words as you learn them. You may want to keep a notebook especially for
new words and their definitions. List synonyms and antonyms across from or beneath the new
word for additional improvement in your vocabulary. Use new words you have learned in your
writing and conversation when appropriate. Dictionaries provide pronunciation guides to help you
pronounce new words properly. Online dictionaries frequently provide a link to a verbal
pronunciation of words. Determine to learn a new word every day. Use a notepad or a calendar
that is large enough for you to write a word and its definition. Select a new word each day from
your dictionary. Write the word on your calendar or notepad and use the word in a sentence. This
method is effective in improving vocabulary, but requires dedication. Read something new every
day. Set aside a time each day to read an article in the newspaper, on a website, or in a magazine.
The more you read, the more words you will encounter, which will improve your vocabulary.
```
###### 11.4 Reasoning and Background knowledge

```
Background Knowledge Enables Readers To Choose Between Multiple Meanings of Words. For
example, think about the word operation. If you were to read the word in a sports article about the
Yankees, you might think about Derek Jeter recovering from his latest baseball injury. Reading and
listening require readers to make inferences from text that rely on background knowledge. Even the
most immediate oral language exchanges, like “What do you say?” to a young child who just
received some Halloween candy, require some level of inference. From infancy on, oral language
comprehension requires children to actively construct meaning by supplying missing knowledge
and making inferences. This, of course, becomes even more complicated when we turn to written
texts, since it may require students to make inferences based on limited information in the text
itself. In fact, many of our greatest writers engage readers through their writing to think beyond the
text. Background knowledge acts as a road map for students, allowing them to stay on target
despite the interesting details. This suggests that once print has been decoded into words, reading
comprehension and listening comprehension requires the active construction of inferences that rely
on background knowledge and are implicit in the text. Deductive reasoning is what many teachers
consider "higher order thinking skills." The student has to use at least two facts, rules, or laws and
to draw a valid conclusion based on the information given. Deductive reasoning is sometimes
presented so that it appears to be more complicated than it actually is. The fact that deductions are
sometimes called logical syllogisms and taught as part of university philosophy courses in logic
allows them to be considered more complex than is necessary to understand them.
```
###### Summary

```
Reading comprehension entails a myriad of skills which are imperative for the successful
interpretation of texts. The skill set comprises decoding, fluency and vocabulary that helps to get
rid of many hurdles faced during the comprehension of any kind of text. Decoding is a key skill for
learning to read that involves taking apart the sounds in words (segmenting) and blending sounds

together. It requires both knowledge of letter-sound relationships, as well as an ability to apply that
knowledge to successfully identify written words and make meaning. Decoding is essential to
reading. It allows students to figure out most words they’ve heard but have never seen in print, as
well as sound out words they’re not familiar with. Fluency is defined as the ability to read and
comprehend with some speed, accuracy, and proper expression. Fluency is also important for
motivation; students who find reading laborious tend not to want read. As readers head into upper
college grades, fluency becomes increasingly important. Vocabulary refers to the words we must
understand to communicate effectively. Educators often consider four types of vocabulary:
listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Reading vocabulary refers to the words we need to know
to understand what we read.

###### Introduction

Writing skills include all the knowledge and abilities related to expressing ideas through the
written word. The ability to clearly communicate ideas through writing is in high demand for
employers in any industry. Well-written documents, emails and posts can persuade customers to
purchase a product or convince investors to partner with a company. Technical knowledge about
writing conventions, style guides and formatting for different situations are also an important part
of writing skills. Knowing what situations call for different styles of writing and being able to set an
appropriate tone over text are both important writing skills that any person can use at work.
Writing skills are an important part of communication. Good writing skills allow you to
communicate your message with clarity and ease to a far larger audience than through face-to-face
or telephone conversations. You may fancy communicating your ideas online via a blog and, of
course, a well written CV or résumé with no spelling or grammatical mistakes are essential if you
want a new job. Today, when anyone can be their own publisher, we see more and more examples
of poor writing skills both in print and on the web. Poor writing skills create poor first impressions
and many readers will have an immediate negative reaction if they spot a spelling or grammatical
mistake. As just one example, a spelling mistake on a commercial web page may cause potential
customers to doubt the credibility of the website and the organization.

English Communication Skills


###### 12.1 Writing Skills

```
Grammar, Spelling and Punctuation
```
```
Correct grammar, punctuation and spelling are important in written communications. The reader
will form an opinion of you, the author, based on both the content and presentation, and errors are
likely to lead them to form a negative impression. If you are unconvinced about the importance of
accurate writing, think of the clues we use to identify spam emails, “phishing” websites, and
counterfeit products: poor grammar and spelling. Similarly, some employers state publicly that
any CV or résumé containing spelling or grammatical mistakes will be rejected immediately, whilst
a BBC news article quotes research that calculates spelling mistakes cost online businesses
“millions” in lost sales. Checking for poor writing and spelling mistakes should be seen as a
courtesy to your readers since it can take them much longer to understand the messages in your
writing if they have to think and re-read text to decipher these. All written communications should
therefore be re-read before sending to print, or hitting the send button in the case of emails, as it is
likely that there will be errors. Do not assume that spelling and grammar checkers will identify all
mistakes as many incorrect words can indeed be spelt correctly (for example, when “their” is used
instead of “there” or “principle” instead of “principal”) or entire words may be missing. If at all
possible, take a break before re-reading and checking your writing, as you are more likely to notice
problems when you read it fresh. Even if you know spelling and grammar rules, you should still
double-check your work or, even better, have it proof-read by somebody else. Our brains work
faster than our fingers can type and accidental typographical errors (typos) inevitably creep in.
```
###### 12.2 Different types of writing

```
Introduction
```
```
Whether you write essays, business materials, fiction, articles, letters, or even just notes in your
journal, your writing will be at its best if you stay focused on your purpose. While there are many
reasons why you might be putting pen to paper or tapping away on the keyboard, there are really
only four main types of writing:
```
1. Expository
2. Persuasive
3. Descriptive
4. Narrative

```
Each of these four writing genres has a distinct aim, and they all require different types of writing
skills. You may also have heard them referred to in an academic setting as modes of
discourse or rhetorical modes. Institutions of higher learning teach nine traditional rhetorical
modes, but the majority of pieces we are called upon to write will have one of these four main
purposes.
```
```
Expository Writing
```
```
The word expository contains the word expose, so the reason expository is an apt descriptor for this
type of writing is that it exposes, or sets forth, facts. It is probably the most common writing genre
you will come across throughout your day. In an expository piece, a topic will be introduced and
laid out in a logical order without reference to the author’s personal opinions.
```
```
For example, Textbooks, Journalism (Except for Opinion and Editorial Articles), Business
writing, Technical writing, Essays, Instructions
```
```
Descriptive writing
```
```
The aim of descriptive writing is to help the reader visualize, in detail, a character, event, place, or
all of these things at once. The author might describe the scene in terms of all five senses.
Descriptive writing allows the writer a great deal more artistic freedom than expository writing
does. Descriptive writing can be found in fiction, poetry, advertising, journal and diary writing.
```
```
For example,
```
```
The children pedaled leisurely down the Happyville Bike Trail, their giggles and whoops
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 12: Writing Skills
reverberating through the warm spring air. Sweet-scented wildflowers brought an array
of color to the gently undulating landscape, tempting the children to dismount now and
then so they could lay down in the springy, soft grass. Through description, this passage
paints a vivid picture of a scene on the new bike trail.
```
**Persuasive writing**

The aim of persuasive writing, or argumentation, is to influence the reader to assume the author’s
point of view. The author will express personal opinions in the piece and arm him- or herself with
evidence so that the reader will agree with him or her. Persuasive writing can be found in
advertising, opinion and editorial pieces, reviews and job Applications.

```
For example,
```
```
The bike trail is the glittering gem of Hapeville’s new infrastructure. It winds through
sixty-two miles of lush landscape, dotted by clean and convenient facilities. If you
haven’t experienced the Hapeville Bike Trail yet, ditch your car and head outside! Could
life in Hapeville get any more idyllic?
```
```
A number of statements in this paragraph are opinion rather than fact:
```
- that the bike trail is a glittering gem, that the facilities are clean and convenient, and
    that life in Hapeville is idyllic.
- Clearly, the author’s aim here is to use these depictions to persuade readers to use
    the bike trail.

**Narrative writing**

The purpose of narrative writing is to tell a story, whether that story is real or imaginary. Pieces in
a narrative style will have characters, and through the narrative, the reader learns what happens to
them. Narrative writing can also include dialogue. Narrative writing can be found in all types of
fiction, biographies, human interest stories and anecdotes.

###### 12.3 Components of the writing process

Regardless of the type of writing you hope to do, it's important to make sure you understand the
components of the writing process. There are five major components of the writing process.

**Prewriting**

Prewriting is the process of gathering ideas and information for your project. This could include
general brainstorming, doing Background research at the library or online, conducting Interviews,
writing character sketches, making an outline.

**Writing**

After you've thought about what you hope to accomplish with your project, it's time to start
actually writing the first draft. Every writer has a unique routine for this part of the process. Some
write in the morning, while others write just before they go to sleep at night. Some people prefer to
write in a home office, while others work best in a coffee shop surrounded by other people. Many
writers prefer to write on a daily schedule to keep them motivated, but there are also a number of
writers who only work when inspiration strikes. Regardless of your particular writing routine,
remember that writing requires both concentration and energy. Even experienced writers can
seldom manage to write for hours at a time. It's perfectly acceptable to allow yourself a small break
after an hour of uninterrupted writing.


```
Revising
```
```
Many novice freelance writers make the mistake of thinking that once they've finished a first draft,
their work is complete. Unfortunately, your first draft is seldom representative of your best work.
Every writer understands that rewriting is one of the key parts of the writing process. Rewriting
may include: adding sections to provide more detail where it is needed, removing sections that are
repetitious or unnecessary, replacing sections with more vivid prose and rearranging parts of the
piece to improve the overall flow. Revising is often where critique groups can come into play,
especially if you're working on a longer project such as a book proposal. As a writer, it's natural to
be attached to your project. However, what seems like brilliant prose to you may very well be
confusing to the reader. Having a group of people review your work will give you new insights
into what needs to be changed or improved. Even if some of the criticism is hard for your ego to
take, this will make you a much better writer in the end.
```
```
Editing
```
```
Editing involves checking over the smaller details that you've ignored until now in favor of
focusing on the overall structure of your work.
```
```
During the editing process, you are evaluating grammar, spelling, punctuation, word
choice and formatting mistakes.
```
```
Most writers simply edit their own work before they attempt to submit it for publication, since it
will undoubtedly be edited again before it is released to a wider audience. However, if you really
struggle with the mechanics of the English language, you may want to consider hiring a freelance
editor to assist you with this part of the process. Brilliant prose is unlikely to impress your reader if
it is littered with spelling and grammatical errors.
```
```
Publishing
```
```
Publishing simply involves distributing your work in its finished format. For a freelance writer, this
is generally interpreted as distributing the project to the client, sending off a query letter, or
submitting a book proposal. While the goal is to have your work met with enthusiastic reviews,
rejection is often one of the components of the writing process. A client may not like the way you
handled his press release or a magazine may feel your idea isn't suitable for their audience. Don't
let this keep you from pursuing your dream of a freelance writing career. Consider their
suggestions, revise your work, and try again. In the end, your persistence will pay off.
```
```
Ways to improve writing skills
```
```
Sometimes, it looks like students’ writing evolves naturally: from a few squiggles, to random
strings of letters, to increasingly conventional writing, and eventually progressing to well-crafted
essays. But just like learning to read, learning to write is not a natural process. To ensure that you
become skilled writers, you need to learn in a systematic way combined with many opportunities
to write and to receive feedback. Basic writing skills: These include spelling, capitalization,
punctuation, handwriting and keyboarding, and sentence structure (e.g., learning to eliminate run-
ons and sentence fragments). Basic writing skills are sometimes called the “mechanics” of
writing. Generating text: Text generation involves putting our thoughts into words, what might be
thought of as the “content” of writing. Text generation includes word choice (vocabulary),
elaboration of detail, and clarity of expression. Planning and editing: Especially after the earliest
grades, good writing involves planning, revising, and editing your own work. These skills are
indispensable in becoming a good writer, and increasingly so as students advance into the middle
and secondary grades. Writing knowledge includes an understanding of discourse and genre — for
example, understanding that a narrative is organized differently than an informational text.
Students also need to learn that they are writing for an audience so they need to convey meaning
clearly to the people who will be reading their work. Professional writing is a complex process that
involves different skills for planning, drafting and editing. Great writers must be able to quickly
learn new concepts and translate ideas into original content. Some areas of writing are highly
specialized and require extensive knowledge in a single area, like scientific or legal writing. Others
use broad soft skills to relate to an audience through creative writing or blogging. Some of the best
writing skills include research, outlining, editing, reading comprehension and time management.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 12: Writing Skills
```
**_Research_**

Research allows writers to find accurate information and best practices related to writing in a
particular style or about a particular piece of content. Writers often have to write about subjects that
they are not familiar with, so finding quality sources quickly is an important skill.

**_Outlining_**

Outlining is creating a plan for the structure and flow of a piece of writing. Good writing needs to
have a logical structure in order to make sense to a reader. Your ability to organize sentences and
paragraphs in the most compelling way influences how others perceive you and understand the
point of your writing.

**_Editing_**

After writing the first draft of your piece, you need to be able to edit. From checking an email for
spelling errors to re-writing a grant proposal, all writing should undergo some level of editing.
Editing involves reading your own writing from another perspective and considering how well it
suits your goals. When editing your own work, think about your word choice and tone, removing
any irrelevant phrases.

**_Reading Comprehension_**

Reading comprehension skills help you respond to prompts, reply to messages and learn about
new content. People use reading comprehension skills to assess the tone and main idea of a piece of
writing. Having good reading comprehension also helps you edit your own work by determining
if your point comes across from the perspective of a reader.

**_Time management_**

Time management is key when writing anything beyond a simple message or email. You should be
able to spend your time efficiently when writing and accurately plan for how long it will take to
write and edit your piece. Many writers over-edit their work and end up wasting time without
improving the quality of their writing, so a good writer must recognize when to step away from a
piece of writing.

**_Take grammar quizzes_**

Even the most experienced writers have trouble with grammar, and taking grammar quizzes or
playing games online is a great way to hone your knowledge of spelling and sentence structure.

**_Know your audience_**

Practice writing one prompt for different audiences and notice how your tone shifts. Before you
begin writing, consider what your audience values and how you can use your word choice and
sentence structure to appeal to them.

**_Read your writing aloud_**

Read your writing aloud during the editing process to catch any errors that you might not have
noticed otherwise. Reading aloud also helps you hear any awkward phrasing and get an idea of
your overall tone and effectiveness.

**_Vary your sentence structure_**

As you write, try to vary your sentence structure to give your writing rhythm. A mix of short and
long sentences with different literary devices can keep the reader interested and create a natural
flow that guides them through your writing.


```
Practice daily
```
```
Even if you don't have to write at work everyday, practice writing in some way every day. Focus
your time on the types of writing where you most need to improve. Give yourself writing prompts
and challenge yourself to try out different skills.
```
```
Read regularly
```
```
One of the best ways to improve your writing is to read a variety of writing styles daily. The more
exposure you have to quality writing, the better you will be able to produce great writing yourself.
Reading helps you understand how to apply the writing skills you have learned.
```
```
Give your writing a structure
```
```
It’s fine to rattle off a stream of consciousness when you’re writing in your journal, but if you
actually want to communicate with others you’ll need to bring some order to those rambling
thoughts.
```
```
Anticipate your reader’s questions
```
```
Improving writing involves putting yourself in your readers’ shoes. Do they have enough context
to understand what you’ve written for them? If not, fill in the blanks.
```
###### 12.4 Cohesion and Coherence

```
Cohesion refers to the many ways (grammatical, lexical, semantic, metrical, alliterative) in which
the elements of a text are linked together. Cohesion differs from coherence in that a text can be
internally cohesive but be incoherent – that is, make no sense. Here is a text that is grammatically
and lexically cohesive, but not very coherent:
An octopus is an air-filled curtain with seven heads and three spike-filled fingers, which poke in frills and
furls at ribbon-strewed buttons.
```
```
Grammatical cohesion
```
```
The clause-structure obeys normal English grammatical rules (which is itself a form of cohesion):
```
```
Anaphoric reference
```
```
which poke refers back to the fingers
```
```
Lexical cohesion - semantic fields:
```
```
heads, fingers (body parts)
```
```
curtain, frills, furls, ribbons,
```
```
buttons (haberdashery)
```
```
However the text only makes sense if we invent some kind of other-world context. Notice how our
tendency is to want to make sense of it, to find some kind of science-fictional or poetical
circumstance whereby it could make sense.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 12: Writing Skills
```
When it comes to planned, non-spontaneous texts including written discourse and speeches, the
manner in which the text is put together can be explained by elements of coherence and cohesion.
While spontaneous discourse will also display coherence and cohesion, it is emphasized in planned
texts because there is a greater deal of thought and intention behind the use of cohesive ties and
devices of coherence. Coherence is defined as the quality of being logical, consistent and able to be
understood.

Imagine coherence as a building (It’s an analogy, go with it. Cohesion on the other hand refers to
the act of forming a whole unit. It is effectively a subset of coherence. Picture cohesion as the bricks
and cement which make up the building. Bricks and cement can be put together to create any form
of structure. However, it is only when they are laid together properly that they form a building.
Similarly, a text will be cohesive if cohesive ties are used however it will only be coherent if the
cohesive ties are used appropriately to create meaning. You can have cohesion without coherence
but you cannot have coherence without cohesion. The picture does not make sense unless the
correct pieces are placed in the correct order, even if certain pieces may be the same size and shape.

Cohesive devices effectively help the discourse flow. They include:

- Collocations
- Lexical repetition
- Linking adverbials
- Substitution
- Ellipsis
- Conjunctions
- Synonymy/ antonymy
- Hypernyms /hyponyms
- Referencing (anaphoric, cataphoric, deictic).

These devices create physical links between the words in a discourse.

```
Coherence which we previously defined as understanding can be achieved through devices
such as,
```
- Cohesive ties
- Formatting techniques
- Inference
- Logical ordering of information
- Semantic patterning
- Consistency

These all enhance the ability of a text to be successfully interpreted and understood. Recipes, terms
and condition documents, informative brochures all make use of formatting in the form of
headings, bolding, underlines etc. to emphasize certain aspects of the text and draw audience
attention to the most important elements. The focus of coherence factors is determined by the social
purpose of the text. Is the text made to entertain? Inform? Persuade? Celebrate? If so, why? What is
the overarching intention of the text? Answering such questions can help explain the purpose of
coherence factors and cohesive devices within a discourse. The focus of coherence factors is
determined by the social purpose of the text. Is the text made to entertain? Inform? Persuade?
Celebrate? If so, why? What is the overarching intention of the text? Answering such questions can
help explain the purpose of coherence factors and cohesive devices within a discourse. Lexical
choices which require outside inference would be included if it can be reasonably interpreted that
the intended audience would be aware of their meaning. Finding examples of inference in texts can
be useful in identifying the social purpose of the text. Cohesive devices, sometimes called linking
words, linkers, connectors, discourse markers or transitional words. Cohesive devices are words or
phrases that show the relationship between paragraphs or sections of a text or speech. Cohesive
devices are words like ‘For example‘, ‘In conclusion‘, ‘however‘ and ‘moreover‘.


```
Anaphoric reference
```
```
Anaphoric Reference means that a word in a text refers back to other ideas in the text for its
meaning. For example:
```
```
‘I went out with Jo on Sunday. She looked awful.’ ́She` clearly refers to Jo, there is no need to
repeat her name.
```
```
Cataphoric References
```
```
Cataphoric reference means that a word in a text refers to another later in the text and you need to
look forward to understand. For example: When he arrived, John noticed that the door was open’.
```
```
Exophoric Reference
```
```
Exophoric reference refers to an idea outside the text. This is a reference to world knowledge
shared by the reader. For example,
```
```
"The Prime Minister responded quickly to the threat.”
```
```
Here we are expected to know who the Prime Minister is.
```
```
Tense Agreement
```
```
Tense agreement refers to the way that writers use tenses to make a text hang together.
```
```
For example, “She knew then that he... “had found her letter” is a logical ending to the sentence.
We are not surprised to see past perfect after simple past in a narrative sentence.”
```
```
Linkers
```
```
Linkers refers to words or phrases that describe the relationship between ideas in the text
```
```
For example, “And, but, therefore, first of all”
```
```
Substitution
```
```
Substitution or Ellipsis refers to replacing words, or leaving them out– this is how writers reduce
repetition in a text. For example, “Now we’re finishing our essays. I know you want to go out, but
before you can do that, please finish. ‘do that’ avoids a repetition of ‘go out’. Instead of repeating
‘finish our essays’ ‘our essays’ is dropped from the sentence”
```
```
Synonyms
```
```
Synonyms are words that have essentially the same meaning, and they provide some variety in
your word choices, helping the reader to stay focused on the idea being discussed.
```
###### 12.5 Sentence Expanding

**What is sentence expanding?**

```
Sentence expanding is the process of adding one or more words, phrases, or clauses to the main
clause (or independent clause) to do just that: expand your sentences. Sentence-expanding exercises
are often used in conjunction with sentence combining and sentence-imitation exercises. Together,
these activities may serve as a supplement or an alternative to more traditional methods
of grammar and writing instruction. The primary purpose of using sentence-expanding exercises
in composition is to enrich a student's thinking and attention to detail in storytelling while
heightening his or her awareness of the variety of available sentence structures. All together, it
gives students the ability to paint a more vivid picture and express a more complex thought.

###### Summary

Good writing skills allow you to communicate your message with clarity and ease to a far larger
audience than through face-to-face or telephone conversations. You may fancy communicating
your ideas online via a blog and, of course, a well written CV or résumé with no spelling or
grammatical mistakes are essential if you want a new job. It is important for the parts of a written
text to be connected together. Another word for this is cohesion. This word comes from the
word cohere, which means 'to stick together'. Cohesion is therefore related to ensuring that the
words and sentences you use stick together. The words 'cohesion' and 'coherence' are often used
together with a similar meaning, which relates to how an academic text joins together to make a
unified whole. Although they are similar, they are not the same. Cohesion relates to the micro level
of the text, i.e. the words and sentences and how they join together. Coherence, in contrast, relates
to the organization and connection of ideas and whether they can be understood by the reader, and
as such is concerned with the macro level features of a text, such as topic sentences, thesis
statement, the summary in the concluding paragraph (dealt with in the essay structure section), and
other 'bigger' features including headings such as those used in reports. Coherence can be
improved by using an outline before writing (or a reverse outline, which is an outline written after
the writing is finished), to check that the ideas are logical and well organized. Asking a peer to
check the writing to see if it makes sense, i.e. peer feedback, is another way to help improve
coherence in your writing.

After studying this unit, you will be able to
```
- learn different ways of arranging sentences to construct a meaningful paragraph
- revise the rules of rearrangement of jumbled sentences
- become well versed with different aspects of constructing a paragraph
- understand the rules of writing a paragraph in English
- able to employ effective tools for writing a well organized paragraph

###### Introduction

**What is rearrangement?**

```
Rearrangement of jumbled sentences into a meaningful paragraph entails knowledge about
cohesion and coherence. Rearrangement means the process of changing the order of a set of
different sentences to establish the central idea of a paragraph. The sentences should be arranged in
such a way that the paragraph is in accordance with the syntaxes and semantics. Generally there is
a central idea, thought or some personality description on which a paragraph is written. Try to
locate the sentence which contains such matter. Mostly such a sentence forms the first or the last
sentence of the paragraph. There are two methods to describe the central idea. First in the opening
sentence a central point is mentioned. Thereafter, the sentences following that give logical
description or details of that and to elaborate the same, some examples are given. In the second
method, some facts are given in the opening sentences of the paragraph and their result is given in
the concluding lines. Try to find out the sentence containing the central idea and arrange the
remaining sentences accordingly. Sentences containing proper nouns i.e. names of people, places or
buildings etc or abstract nouns like qualities i.e. goodness or beauty etc come in the opening line or
in the few starting lines of the paragraph. Sentences containing pronouns like he, his, him, she, her,
they, their, them or first or last part of a name come in the subsequent part of the paragraph.
Pronouns like it, this that, these or those show that these mention about the topic already detailed
in the sentences preceding them. So, these sentences generally do not form the first line of the
paragraph. Sentences containing words like therefore, but, and, accordingly, or resultantly etc.
come in the central part of the paragraph. The first sentence of the paragraph may contain
introductory details of something and the last line of the paragraph contains conclusions of some
logical details given in it. Sometimes, words like initially, eventually, finally, hence, ensuing,
proceeding, following or mentioned below or above in the sentence also indicate the location of that
particular sentence in the paragraph. In some paragraphs, there are sentences giving statements in
```

```
favor of or against an argument. Try to sort out and arrange sentences of both types separately. This
helps in framing the paragraph. Initially, it may not be as easy as stated, but a little practice makes
it very easy.
```
###### 13.1 Strategies for sentence rearrangement

- Ignore reading the sentence, over and over, it just take your more often than not
- Survey the choices; if each of the choices begins with different letters, pick the sentence to
    begin the gathering prompts the right answer
- In choices that are almost related, pick an compulsory pair of sentences
- Pay special mind to quick bits of data, for example, pronouns, conjunctions
- At the primary spot of sentences to offer you some help with setting up a gathering
- Pay special mind to quick bits of data, for example, pronouns, conjunctions
- At the primary spot of sentences to offer you some help with setting up a gathering

###### 13.2 Components of a good paragraph

```
A good paragraph has three important parts. A Topic Sentence tells about the limited topic of a
paragraph and expresses the focusing idea or conveys the main point of the paragraph. It provides
the idea to the reader what she or he is going to read after that. Supporting Sentence provide
detailed information to the readers from which they become able to understand the topic sentence.
The Concluding Sentence ends the paragraph and by completing a full circle comes back to that
idea which was introduced by the topic sentence. Try to find out the topic addressed by the
paragraph. This can be done by looking for the words that are repeated often in the given
sentences. If a particular word is repeated in more than one sentence then the sentences can be
placed one by one in the paragraph. If a sentence starts with a ‘name’ of a person, then that
sentence will definitely be the 1st sentence in the paragraph to be formed. If a sentence starts with
pronouns other than ‘I’ and ‘You’, then that sentence will not be the 1st sentence of the paragraph.
The sentences starting with the words ‘That’, ‘These’, ‘Thus’ and ‘Those’, then those sentences will
not come 1st in the paragraph. If an article namely ‘a’, ‘an’ or ‘the’ is present at the starting of a
sentence. Then the chances of that sentence being the 1st in the arrangement are more.
```
```
If all the articles (a, an, the) are present as the starting words of different sentences then they are
arranged as follows:
```
1. The sentence starting with ‘A’ comes first
2. The sentences starting with ‘An’ and ‘The’ will follow the sentence starting with ‘A’ according
    to their content
3. If there are 3-sentences starting with the words ‘But’, ‘So’ and ‘Now’ respectively.

```
Then those 3-sentences will be arranged in the following order
```
1. sentence starting with ‘But’
2. sentence starting with ‘So’
3. sentence starting with ‘Now’

```
If the given set of sentences consists of simple, compound, and complex sentences they are
arranged in the following order
```
- Simple sentence – a sentence that consists of basic elements like a subject, a verb, and a
    completed thought

```
For example, Arun waited for the bus.
```
- Compound sentence – a sentence that consists of 2-independent clauses connected to one
    another with a conjunction

```
For example, Arun waited for the bus, but the bus was late.
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 13: Writing skills
```
- Complex sentence – a sentence that consists of an independent clause and one or more

```
dependent clauses connected to it
```
For example, Arun realized that the bus was late while he waited at the bus stop.

Or

While he waited at the bus stop, Arun realized that the bus was late.

```
If a sentence starts with the words ‘Hence, Finally or Therefore’, then that sentence
comes last in the arrangement.
```
###### 13.3 Paragraph Writing

Paragraphs are distinct blocks of text which section out a larger piece of writing—stories, novels,
articles, creative writing or professional writing pieces—making it easier to read and understand.
Good paragraphs are a handy writing skill for many forms of literature, and good writers can
greatly enhance the readability of their news, essays, or fiction writing when constructed properly.
A good paragraph is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence), relevant supporting sentences,
and a closing (or transition) sentence. This structure is essential to keep your paragraph focused on
the main idea and creating a clear and concise image. While creative writing does not necessarily
follow the traditional paragraph structure, it’s more about scene building and continuing a
narrative. Efficient, well-written paragraphs are a staple of good flash fiction and short fiction
writing, as short stories need to stay more focused on a central idea. As long as your sentences form
cohesive ideas and connect to one another, you can write a good paragraph.

**How to structure and write better paragraphs?**

- Whether you’re writing a short paragraph or a long paragraph, each should follow the
    same basic rules of structure.
- While this format is not as rigid when writing fiction as it is for non-fiction, the
    information or story you craft must logically or sequentially relate to the next paragraph.
- These elements help the coherency of your body paragraphs, tying them together to unify
    around an idea, or set up a narrative story.
- Make The First Sentence of your topic sentence.
- The first line of your first paragraph sets up what information is to come as your audience
    reads on.
- Even in fiction, the introduction of a paragraph either establishes an idea or scenario or
    continues one from the paragraph before.
- Regardless of what format or genre you’re writing for, every good paragraph starts with a
    central focus that the rest of the paragraph will aim to support.
- Provide support via The Middle Sentences.
- These sentences include follow-up information to your key sentence or previous
    paragraph.
- Whatever idea you aim to convey, these sentences are where you convince your reader to
    believe or envision what you do, and give them everything they need to see your point of
    view.
- Make your Last Sentence a Conclusion or transition.
- Even if it’s not at the end of the piece, a conclusive sentence can refer to the last line of its
    own paragraph, which concludes a particular idea or train of thought before moving on to
    start a new line for the next paragraph.
- This next paragraph can continue on the same idea, but the ending of each paragraph
    should briefly summarize the information that was provided before moving on.
- Know when To Start A New Paragraph.


- A paragraph break is necessary when starting a new topic, introducing a new
    speaker, contrasting other POVs or ideas, or providing white space to give readers a pause
    from a longer paragraph.
- For example, in a novel, you may start a new paragraph when bringing in a new character,
    or specify when a different character is speaking, which can help the reader separate
    action text from dialogue more readily.
- Paragraph breaks can control the pacing of your writing, and generate particular feelings
    or moods for your reader.
- While there is no set amount of sentences required per paragraph, in some instances, a
    single paragraph may consist of a single sentence, but it is acceptable as long as it supports
    your central idea, and doesn’t overwhelm your audience with too much information.
- Use Transition Words.
- Transition words help tie together separate paragraphs, connecting them to form a
    coherent idea.
- Phrases like “in addition” or “moreover” can help readers track your ideas and
    understand how they relate to each other, making for a smoother, more pleasant reading
    experience.
- This is especially useful for essay writers and bloggers, who often focus on a singular idea
    at a time to share with their audience.
- Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be,
    you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper.
- What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader?
- The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea.
- In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent
    relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph.
- A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow.
- The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown
    paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.
- The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a
    seed of ideas; this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming.
- There are many techniques for brainstorming; whichever one you choose, this stage of
    paragraph development cannot be skipped.
- Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned
    foundation that supports what you are building.
- Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole
    paper to crumble.

```
Every paragraph in a paper should be:
```
- Unified: All of the sentences in a single paragraph should be related to a single controlling idea
    (often expressed in the topic sentence of the paragraph).
- Clearly related to the thesis: The sentences should all refer to the central idea, or thesis, of the
    paper.
- Coherent: The sentences should be arranged in a logical manner and should follow a definite
    plan for development.
- Well-developed: Every idea discussed in the paragraph should be adequately explained and
    supported through evidence and details that work together to explain the paragraph’s
    controlling idea.

Unit 13: Writing skills
```
**Organizing a paragraph**

There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend
on the controlling idea of the paragraph.

**_Narration_** : Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish.

```
One North Carolina man found quite a surprise last year while fishing in the Catawba
River: a piranha. Jerry Melton, of Gastonia, reeled in a one pound, four ounce fish with an
unusual bite. Melton could not identify it, but a nearby fisherman did. Melton at first could
not believe he had caught a piranha. He said, “That ain’t no piranha. They ain’t got piranha
around here.” Melton was right: the fish is native to South America, and North Carolina
prohibits owning the fish as a pet or introducing the species to local waterways. The sharp-
toothed, carnivorous fish likely found itself in the Catawba River when its illegal owner
released the fish after growing tired of it. Wildlife officials hope that the piranha was the
only of its kind in the river, but locals are thinking twice before they wade in the water.
```
**_Description_** : Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels
like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic.

```
Piranhas are omnivorous, freshwater fish, which are mostly known for their single row of
sharp, triangular teeth in both jaws. Piranhas’ teeth come together in a scissor-like bite and
are used for puncture and tearing. Baby piranha are small, about the size of a thumbnail,
but full-grown piranha grow up to about 6-10 inches, and some individual fish up to 2 feet
long have been found. The many species of piranha vary in color, though most are either
silvery with an orange underbelly and throat or almost entirely black.
```
**_Process_** : Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequence—first, second,
third.

```
You can safely swim with piranhas, but it’s important to know how and when to do it.
First, chose an appropriate time, preferably at night and during the rainy season. Avoid
piranha-infested waters during the dry season, when food supplies are low and piranhas
are more desperate. Piranhas feed during the day, so night-time swimming is much safer.
Second, streamline your movement. Wild or erratic activity attracts the attention of
piranhas. Swim slowly and smoothly. Finally, never enter the water with an open wound
or raw meat. Piranhas attack larger animals only when they are wounded. The presence of
blood in the water may tempt the fish to attack. If you follow these simple precautions, you
will have little to fear.
```
**_Classification_** : Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic

```
Piranhas comprise more than 30-60 species of fish, depending on whom you ask. The many
species fall into four genera: Pygocentrus, Pygopristis, Serrasalmus, and Pristobrycon.
Piranhas in the Pygocentrus genus are the most common variety, the kind you might find
in a pet store. Pygopristis piranhas are herbivores, feasting on seeds and fruits, not flesh. In
contrast, fish in the Serrasalmus genus eat only meat, and their teeth are razor-sharp.
Pristobrycon are the least friendly of all piranhas; they often bite the fins of other fish, even
fish of the same species. The label piranha, then, refers to a wide variety of species.
```
Illustration: Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. Let’s walk
through a 5-step process for building this type of paragraph. For each step, there is an explanation
and example. Our example paragraph will be about human misconceptions of piranhas.

**_Step 1_**

- Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence
- Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea.
- This idea directs the paragraph’s development.
- Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence.


- In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph’s controlling idea.
- Controlling idea and topic sentence: Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless,
    many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that piranhas are dangerous to humans.

```
Step 2
```
- Elaborate on the controlling idea
- Paragraph development continues with an elaboration on the controlling idea, perhaps with an
    explanation, implication, or statement about significance.
- Our example offers a possible explanation for the pervasiveness of the myth.
- Elaboration: This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in popular
    media.

```
Step 3
```
- Give an example (or multiple examples)
- Paragraph development progresses with an example (or more) that illustrate the claims made
    in the previous sentences.
- For example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film Piranha features an oversized
    piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman.

```
Step 4
```
- Explain the example(s)
- The next movement in paragraph development is an explanation of each example and its
    relevance to the topic sentence.
- The explanation should demonstrate the value of the example as evidence to support the major
    claim, or focus, in your paragraph.
- Continue the pattern of giving examples and explaining them until all points/examples that
    the writer deems necessary have been made and explained.

```
None of your examples should be left unexplained. You might be able to explain the
relationship between the example and the topic sentence in the same sentence which
introduced the example. More often, however, you will need to explain that
relationship in a separate sentence.
```
```
Explanation for example: Such a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination
and promotes unnecessary fear.
```
```
Step 5
```
- Complete the paragraph’s idea or transition into the next paragraph
- The final movement in paragraph development involves tying up the loose ends of the
    paragraph.
- At this point, you can remind your reader about the relevance of the information to the larger
    paper, or you can make a concluding point for this example.
- You might, however, simply transition to the next paragraph.
- Sentences for completing a paragraph — While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends
    excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the real-life piranha.
- By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this
    inaccurate belief.

**_Finished paragraph_**

Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the
pervasive myth that piranhas are dangerous to humans. This impression of piranhas is exacerbated
by their mischaracterization in popular media. For example, the promotional poster for the 1978
horror film Piranha features an oversized piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman.
Such a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination and promotes unnecessary fear.
While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little
resemblance to the real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may
finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.

```
Notice that the example and explanation steps of this 5-step process (steps 3 and 4) can be
repeated as needed. The idea is that you continue to use this pattern until you have
completely developed the main idea of the paragraph.
```
**Characteristics of an effective paragraph**

- It presents a single idea.
- It begins with a topic sentence that makes this single idea evident.
- It contains support in form of sentences that convey this single idea.
- It is Strategically Organized To Maintain Flow
- It maintains Your Essay’s Objective
- It informs And Entertains Your Reader About Your Paper’s Overall Idea

###### 13.4 Common mistakes in paragraph writing

**Stylistic/ Technical mistakes**

- Italicize the title of a major work (novel, play, movie)

```
Example: The Merchant of Venice
(if you are writing it out, you underline the title)
```
- Put the title of short works in quotation marks (essays, short stories, poetry)

```
Example: “The Fall of a City”
```
**Structural continuity**

- The way your thesis is written dictates the order your essay will follow.
- If your thesis says “Teddy is kind, imaginative, and intelligent” your first body paragraph will

```
discuss kindness, second imagination, and third intelligence.
```
- Also, when you restate your thesis in the conclusion, it must be written in the same order.

**Language**

Stay consistent in the present tense or past tense whenever possible. Example of events that happen
during the story:
Antonio lends money to his best friend Bassanio. He is sure that his ships will return in time to
repay Shylock. Not Antonio lent money to his best friend Bassanio. He is sure that his ships will
return in time to repay Shylock.


**Ambiguous Pronoun Reference**

```
When discussing a character you must always refer to that character using his or her name at least
once in a sentence, sometimes more (especially when discussing two or more characters of the same
gender in one sentence).
```
```
Incorrect example,
```
```
Antonio would do anything for Bassanio because he loves him like a brother.
```
```
In the above sentence, it is unclear who loves who like a brother.
```
```
Correct example,
```
```
Antonio would do anything for Bassanio because he loves Bassanio like a brother.
```
```
Incorrect example,
```
```
She agreed to marry whoever solves the riddle correctly.
```
```
Who is this sentence referring to?
```
```
Correct example,
```
```
Portia agreed to marry whoever solves the riddle correctly
```
**Always use formal language**

- No slang
- No contractions (it’s; he’s; that’s; etc)
- Only use the third person (No first person “I” “me” and No second person “we” “us.”)
- Do not refer to your essay or any part of your essay.

```
Incorrect examples,
```
```
This proves my thesis because...
```
```
This quote shows that...
```
```
In my next paragraph...
```
```
As I stated in my introduction...
```
```
Therefore, my essay has proven that...
```
**Transition from one idea to the next**

```
Use transition words or phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs.
```
```
For example, Bassanio’s friendship with Antonio is one of loyalty, even to the point of death.
Nevertheless, Bassanio is committed to Portia as his wife and faces a conflict of interest when
Antonio encourages him to give away his ring.
```
###### 13.5 Structural mistakes

- Always relate your point back to your thesis at the end of a paragraph.
- The risk which Antonio took for Bassanio demonstrates that true friendship is based on
    supporting each other, no matter the circumstance.
- Always analyze your quotations; NEVER assume your reader will understand. Use the PEE
    strategy (Point Evidence Explanation)

###### Summary

A good paragraph has three important parts. A Topic sentence tells about the limited topic of a
paragraph and expresses the focusing idea or conveys the main point of the paragraph. It provides
the idea to the reader what she or he is going to read after that. Supporting Sentence provide
detailed information to the readers from which they become able to understand the topic sentence.
The Concluding sentence ends the paragraph and by completing a full circle comes back to that
idea which was introduced by the topic sentence. Try to find out the topic addressed by the
paragraph. This can be done by looking for the words that are repeated often in the given
sentences. The fact of the matter is that although you may have numerous valid facts or
descriptions related to your paragraph’s core idea, you may lose a reader’s attention if your
paragraphs are too long. What’s more, if all of your paragraphs are long, you may lose
opportunities to draw your reader in. Journalists, for example, know that their readers respond
better to short paragraphs. News readers generally lose interest with long descriptions and even
one-sentence paragraphs are considered both acceptable and impactful. When it comes to
maintaining a reader’s attention, a good rule of thumb might be to avoid writing more than five or
six sentences in a paragraph before finding a logical place to break. That said, remember that the
idea behind a paragraph might be short and sweet, or it might merit deeper explanation. There are
no strict rules about how many words or lines your paragraphs should be, and there’s no need to
lock your doors if you occasionally write long or short ones. The grammar police aren’t coming for
you.

###### Introduction

```
Letter writing is an essential skill. Despite the prevalence of emails and text messages, everyone has
to write letters at some point. Letters of complaint, job applications, thank you letters, letters
requesting changes or making suggestions — the list goes on and on. Encouraging students to write
letters from an early age will improve their communication, social and handwriting skills, and
teach them what they need to know about writing and structuring letters. Letter writing encourages
good manners, especially writing 'thank you' letters. Students can write invitations. Students can
write letters to friends and relatives. Pen pals are always popular, giving insights into other
students’ lives, especially overseas. Quite apart from curriculum requirements, being asked to write
letters is a task that will appeal to students. The sheer fun of sending and receiving letters appeals
to everyone. There is something special about putting letters into the post box and then having
letters delivered by the postman... the brightly colored stamps, seeing your name on the envelope
and knowing that inside is a long awaited letter from a friend or member of the family. It shows
someone cares and has taken the time to sit down and think about you. Handwritten letters have a
charm of their own. You can take time to think about what you want to say. You can keep letters to
read again and again. You can admire the handwriting; share dreams and thoughts. Responding by
letter is very different to the immediacy of a text message or an email. Before the advent of modern
technology made communication so easy, the art of writing a letter was considered an important
requirement. Even today a letter is an important means of communication in both the workspace as
well as our personal lives. So, let us educate ourselves with the nuances of letter writing.
```
###### 14.1 Letter writing

```
A letter is a written message that can be handwritten or printed on paper. It is usually sent to the
recipient via mail or post in an envelope, although this is not a requirement as such. Any such
message that is transferred via post is a letter, a written conversation between two parties. Now
that E-mails and texts and other such forms have become the norm for communication, the art of
letter writing has taken a backseat. However, even today a lot of our communication, especially
```

```
the formal kind, is done via letters. Whether it is a cover letter for a job, or the bank sending you a
reminder or a college acceptance letter, letters are still an important mode of communication. That
is why it is important that we know the intricacies of letter writing.
```
```
Types of letters
```
```
Let us first understand that there are broadly two types of letter, namely Formal Letters, and
Informal Letters. But then there are also a few types of letters based on their contents, formalities,
the purpose of letter writing etc. Let us have a look at the few types of letters.
```
```
Formal letters
```
```
These letters follow a certain pattern and formality. They are strictly kept professional in nature,
and directly address the issues concerned. Any type of business letter or letter to authorities falls
within this given category.
```
```
Format of a formal letter
```
```
Sender’s address
```
```
Date
```
```
Receiver’s address
```
```
Subject
```
```
Salutation
```
```
Body of the letter
```
```
Complimentary closure
```
```
Signature line
```
```
Sender’s name, Signature and designation
```
- **_Sender’s address_** : One of the most essential components, also known as the return address. It
    is the mailing address of the sender. The address and contact details of the person sending the
    letter are written here.
- **_Date_** : Immediately after the sender’s address comes the date on which the letter is written.
    Candidates, while writing the letter in the exam, can follow any of the formats to write the
    dates: DD/MM/YY OR MM/DD/YY.
- **_Receiver’s address_** : The corresponding address, i.e. the address of the recipient of the mail is
    written here. Candidates must start with the receivers’ designation followed by the name of the
    organization and then the full address, Pin code and country (if the information is known).
- **_The subject_** : This highlights the aim of writing the letter. The subject of the formal letter
    should be very brief (6 to 8 words) and must be preceded by the word ‘Subject’. The receiver,
    through the subject, understands the purpose of the letter at a glance.
- **_Salutation:_** This is a customary greeting to the recipient of the letter. If the name of the
    recipient is known, the salutation starts with ‘Dear’ followed by Mr/Mrs/Miss, etc. If the
    person is unknown or even the gender is not known the recipient can be addressed as Dear
    Sir/Dear Madam.
- **_Body_** : The most important element of any letter. It furnishes the reason behind writing the
    letter. For formal letters, candidates should use short, clear, logical paragraphs to state the
    subject matter. The body of the letter is generally divided into 3 paragraphs:
- Introduction that states the main point.
- Middle part: Supporting points and details to justify the need and importance of letter writing.
- Conclusion: Request for some action or what is expected.

English Communication Skills


```
Unit 14: Composition
```
- **_Complimentary Closure_** : This is to end the letter with respect in a polite manner such as

```
‘yours faithfully’, ‘Yours sincerely’, etc.
```
- **_Signature Line_** : This is the last part where the sender of the letter signs off with his first or last

```
name. The signature line may also include a second line for the title or designation of the
sender.
```
- Use of colloquial words, short forms, slang language and abbreviations are
    restricted.
- The letter must be to the point, precise and clearly indicating the message.
- The subject line is very important in Formal Letters.

**Informal letters**

These are personal letters. They need not follow any set pattern or adhere to any formalities. They
contain personal information or are a written conversation. Informal letters are generally written to
friends, acquaintances, relatives etc.

**_Format of an Informal letter_**

Sender’s address

Date

Salutation

Body of the letter

Sender’s name and signature

- **_Address:_** The sender’s address is important in informal letters. Since informal letters are

```
personal letters and sent to acquaintances or people who are known, the receivers’ address is
only mentioned on the envelope carrying the letter.
```
- **_Date_** : Same as in a formal letter format.
- **_Salutation_** in informal letters can be Dear/Dearest/ Hi/Hello followed by the first

```
name/nickname of the recipient.
```
- **_Body_** : The body in the informal letters can be long and detailed containing diverse feelings,

```
experiences, advice, news, etc.
```
- **_Sender’s name and signature_** are the same as in the formal letters.
    - The subject line is not required in an Informal Letter.
    - No prescribed format has to be strictly followed.
    - The usage of language must be friendly and casual.
    - The letter can have extra information, as per the sender’s choice.

**Business letters**

These letters are written among business correspondents; generally contain commercial
information such as quotations, orders, complaints, claims, letters for collections etc. Such letters
are always strictly formal and follow a structure and pattern of formalities. A business letter is
professional correspondence. That means it follows a set format and a professional, formal tone.
You'll use this format frequently throughout your job search, from cover letters to thank you
notes. A business letter includes contact information, a salutation, the body of the letter,
a complimentary close, and a signature.

- There are rules for everything, from how wide the letter's margins should be to what
    size font to use.


- In general, it's wise to keep the body of your business letter direct and brief.
- Explain why you are writing in your first paragraph.
- Provide more specifics in the next paragraph.
- Use your closing paragraph to reiterate your reason for writing.
- Thank the recipient for reading, and possibly mention follow-up plans.

```
Today, a printed letter is usually reserved for important professional communications, such as
recommendation letters, job cover letters, resignation letters, legal correspondence, and company
communications. Since a letter is a formal mode of communication, you'll want to know how to
write one that is professional. Correct formatting is especially important if you're sending a hard
copy to the recipient rather than an email because the letter needs to fit the page and look good
```

```
```
Use a formal salutation, not a first name, unless you know the person well. If you do not know the
person's gender, you can write out their full name. For instance, "Dear Pat Crody" instead of "Dear
Mr. Crody" or "Dear Ms. Crody."
```
```
Body of Letter
```
```
The first paragraph of your letter should provide an introduction as to why you are writing so that
your reason for contacting the person is obvious from the beginning.Then, in the following
paragraphs, provide specific details about your request or the information you are providing.
The last paragraph of your letter should reiterate the reason you are writing and thank the reader
for reviewing your request. If appropriate, it should also politely ask for a written response or for
the opportunity to arrange a meeting to further discuss your request.

```
```
Best regards,
```
```
Signature
```
```
Handwritten signature (For a hard copy letter, use black or blue ink to sign the letter.)
```
```

```
To make sure your letter looks professional, follow these tips:
```
- Your letter should be simple and focused; make the purpose of your letter clear.
- Left justify your letter.
- Single space your letter and leave a space between each paragraph.
- Use a plain font such as Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, or Verdana.
- The font size should be 10 or 12 points.
- Leave a blank line after the salutation and before the closing.

Unit 14: Composition
```
- Business letters should always be printed on white bond paper rather than on colored paper or

```
personal stationery.
```
- Check for Formatting Errors and Typos
- Once you have written your business letter, proofread it and spell check it on the screen.
- Then print it out and read it through at least one more time, checking for any errors or typos.
- This is important as it's often easier to spot errors on a hard copy.
- Reading it out loud is a good way to catch a mistake.
- Be on the lookout for formatting errors, such as two paragraphs that don’t have a space in

```
between them or lines that are indented incorrectly.
```
- Then, before putting your letter in an envelope, sign above your typed name using black or

```
blue ink.
```
- If you are using Microsoft Word or another word processing program to write your letter,

```
there are templates available that can help you format your letter correctly.
```
**Official letters**

These types of letters are written to inform offices, branches, subordinates of official information. It
usually relays official information like rules, regulations, procedures, events, or any other such
information. Official letters are also formal in nature and follow certain structure and decorum.

**Social letters**

A personal letter written on the occasion of a special event is known as a social letter.
Congratulatory letter, condolence letter, invitation letter etc are all social letters.

**Circular letters**

A letter that announces information to a large number of people is a circular letter. The same letter
is circulated to a large group of people to correspond some important information like a change of
address, change in management, the retirement of a partner etc.

**Employment letters**

Any letters with respect to the employment process, like joining letter, promotion letter, application
letter etc.

**Letter of Appeal**

In detailing something negative happening in your workplace and asking for redress, letters of
appeal have to strike a careful balance. It is important to state the problem and the desired
response clearly and confidently. At the same time, you have to be sure your criticism is
constructive and your tone civil.


```
Letter of Apology
```
```
Apologies are always hard. Believe it or not, knowing how to write a formal letter can actually
make them easier. Get the do's and don'ts of apology letters to help get you through this
challenging situation. These include expressing your remorse, taking responsibility, offering
amends and vowing to not repeat the mistake.

**Letter of Complaint**

Like letters of appeal, letters of complaint have to strike a balance between a firm statement of the
problem and laying the groundwork for a constructive response. When writing a letter of
complaint, it's important to record the event in a concise manner and address the letter to the
correct party.

**Professional email**

A letter doesn't stop being formal just because it's transmitted electronically. For a professional
email, it's important to keep your tone professional and not get overly long. You want to be clear,
concise and to the point. However, it's also important to make sure to include the name, greeting,
body, and salutation, including your credentials.

**Letter of Resignation**

Another kind of business communication is the resignation letter. It's important to think of this
letter, not as your final message to your current workplace, but as the starting-off point for a new
opportunity.


```
Cover letter
```
```
Along with your resume, your cover letter will often be the first thing a potential employer sees.
Make sure to keep your tone light and professional and highlight your experience.
```
```
Letter of Recommendation
```
```
In many cases, the job hunt is less about what you know than who you know. Learn all the
components for how to write a recommendation to increase your chances of success. It's important
in a letter of recommendation to highlight the details and verify relevant skills they have for the job.
```
```
How to write a recommendation letter?
```
- Explain your relationship to the applicant
- Evaluate applicant’s skills and qualifications
- Include specific examples that illustrate the applicant’s strengths
- Summarize why you would recommend the applicant

```
Tips for writing letters
```
```
Now that we have learned the basics of communicating via letters and the types of letters as well,
let us focus on some tips for the actual letter writing.
```
```
Identify the type of letter
```
```
This obviously is the first step of the letter writing process. You must be able to identify the type of
letter you are to be writing. This will be dictated by the person the letter is addressed to and the
information that will be conveyed through the letter. Suppose you were writing to the principal of
your college to ask for leave, this would be a formal letter. But say you were writing to your old
college professor catching up after a long time. Then this would be a personal (informal) letter.
```
```
Make sure you open and close the letter correctly
```
English Communication Skills


```
Unit 14: Composition
```
Opening a letter in the correct manner is of utmost importance. Formal letters open with a
particular structure and greeting that is formal in nature. Informal letters can be addressed to the
person’s name or any informal greeting as the writer wishes. Even when closing the letter, it must
be kept in mind what type of letter is being written. Formal letters end respectfully and
impersonally, whereas informal letters may end with a more personal touch.

**_Establish the main intent of the letter_**

Once you start writing, make sure to get to the point as soon as possible. Especially in formal
letters, it is important to immediately make clear the purpose of the letter.

**_Be careful of the language_**

A letter is always supposed to be polite and considerate. Even if it is a complaint letter, the point
must be made in a careful and courteous manner. So, it is necessary to use polite expressions and
civil language in all types of letters.

**_Length of the letter_**

Another important factor to be considered is the length of the letter you are writing. It should be
kept in mind that formal letters are generally to the point, precise and short. Lengthy formal letters
tend to not have the desired effect on the reader. The length of an informal letter is determined by
the message in the letter and the relation to the recipient.

```
Letters from the famous composer Ludwig Van Beethoven, the author Ernest
Hemingway and King Henry VIII still exist today, providing us with glimpses into their
personal lives.
```
**Importance of letter writing**

**_Letter Writing Requires Thought_**

Opposed to texting or even talking on the phone, letter writing allows the writer to have time to
think about the content they are writing. One of the best features when it comes to writing a letter is
being able to sit down and process your thoughts before actually putting pen to paper. For
someone who is not quick on their feet, writing a letter allows ample time to make sure you are
saying exactly what you want to say. If you make a mistake, you can scrap my thought and start
over again.

**_Penmanship_**

Many schools no longer teach penmanship and cursive, so I would argue letter writing is the
closest we can get to practice our handwriting. Since we are constantly typing on our cell phones or
computers, we very rarely get to write, at least for an extended period of time. It’s amazing how out
of practice we are when it comes to handwriting, and how few young adults can actually sign their
name because of the lack of penmanship classes in schools today. Letter writing is an easy way for
us to practice our handwriting, whether in print or cursive.

**_Tangible communication_**

Unlike a text message or a phone call, a letter is a tangible piece of communication. We can actually
hold on to the pen and paper, and we can read the letters we have received over and over again
without the fear of them being deleted or forgotten. We also have more control in how we
communicate with our letters.

There’s no frustration spurred from autocorrect or accidentally hitting send when we are not
finished with our thought.


```
Countless memories
```
```
Letters can be kept forever! One of the favorite activities is reading letters friends and family have
sent to you over the years. You might have letters that you have kept since you were a child, and
many of them are sentimental because the people who wrote them are no longer living. Grab a pen
and some paper and get to writing. Write a note to a friend telling them how much you appreciate
them or send a thank you note to someone! The content doesn’t have to be fancy; it just has to be
from you. Though it may be a lost art, letter writing will never go out of style.
```
###### 14.2 Notice writing

```
A notice is a formal document that aims to communicate or display information to the public or a
specific group of people. Usually, notices are often displayed in public places, educational
institutions, and government offices or even in newspapers. However, advancements in modern
technology have enabled notices to move from notice boards to digital platforms such as websites,
texts and emails. However, the process of writing a notice has remained relatively unchanged
Apart from the traditional sense, notice is also a concept that has legal implications and is often
used in the context of laws (such as legal notice, actual notice, constructive notice etc.) However,
we shall explore the concept of “notice” from an educational perspective.
```
```
Important points in notice writing
```
- The title must clearly mention “Notice” in caps
- The name of the organization that issues the notice must be mentioned
- A short heading must also be included.
- It must be indicative of the content to be mentioned
- The date must also be mentioned
- The body of the notice must briefly state the purpose of the notice, its conditions, relevant
    information or other details.
- Moreover, it must be concise, yet comprehensive.
- The notice must end with the name, sign and designation of the writer/ person-in-charge
    of issuing the notice.
- Other details – such as the date of the event, place of the event, eligibility, process or other
    details must not be omitted.
- Ideally, the reader must understand what the notice is about at first glance and then plan a
    course of action (if required).
- Lastly, proofread the draft for spelling or grammatical mistakes.
- Also, ensure that the contents of the notice are unambiguous.

###### 14.3 Conveying sympathies

Writing a condolence message can be difficult because of the deep emotion involved. You want to
offer comfort and support, but not say something that will further sadden the recipient. Having a
few examples of condolences by your side will help you get started. Add your own sense of
sincerity thereafter. It's common to feel at a loss for words when someone you know has
experienced the loss of a loved one. It can be hard to craft words of condolence that express your
thoughts. These example condolence messages will help you express how you feel and bring
comfort to those in need.

- Please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers at this difficult time.
- Words seem inadequate to express our sadness over the passing of _____.
- May the love of those around you help you through the days ahead.
- We are deeply sorry to hear about the passing of _____.
- _____ brought so many gifts to our life. We will never forget _____.
- May you take comfort in knowing an angel is watching over you now.
- Words cannot even begin to express our sorrow. You are in our prayers.

**_Formal ways of conveying sympathies_**

- Please accept my deepest condolences on the loss of your beloved _____. You are now and
    will remain in my thoughts and prayers.
- Hold tight to memories for comfort. Lean on your friends for strength. And always
    remember how much you're loved.
- Although no words can ease the loss you bear, know you're very close in our thoughts and
    prayers.
- May the peace that comes from the memories of your love comfort you now and in the
    days ahead.
- Please accept our heartfelt sympathies for your loss. Our thoughts are with you and your
    family during this difficult time.
